DSI000000,Serenoa repens,C4082853,"Saw palmetto is a dwarf palm that grows in the coastal lands of North America, West Indies, and Mediterranean countries. The fruits are a rich source of fatty acids and phytosterols and have been used to promote urination, reduce inflammation, and for treatment of conditions such as benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH).Various heterogeneous extracts of saw palmetto are available, but many basic research and clinical trials used a hexanic extract of S. repens, which has anti-inflammatory, anti-androgenic, and antiproliferative activities . Whereas some data indicate that saw palmetto extracts improve lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) in both male and female patients with BPH, conflicting data suggest no such effects . In another large study, a saw palmetto extract did not affect serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) more than placebo even at high doses . But pretreatment with saw palmetto reduced intra- and postoperative complications in patients who underwent transurethral resection of the prostate and open prostatectomy , and reduced prostatic inflammation . Data also suggest benefits against chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome . A saw palmetto extract was found to inhibit growth of normal prostate cells and increase their sensitivity to radiation in vitro, but did not affect malignant prostate cancer cells . A large epidemiologic study did not find associations with the use of saw palmetto and reduced risk of prostate cancer .In an exploratory study, a hexanic extract of S. repens demonstrated anti-inflammatory effects in patients with BPH-related LUTS . In an open-label study, saw palmetto extract plus tamsulosin was found to be more effective than tamsulosin alone in reducing storage symptoms in BPH patients ; and a randomized trial reported benefits of saw palmetto and bifiprost for preventing chronic bacterial prostatitis due to enterobacteriaceae .Multi-phytotherapy approaches have also been investigated. One study suggests saw palmetto may benefit patients with chronic bacterial prostatitis when co-administered with nettle, curcumin, and quercitin . In addition, saw palmetto exerted anti-inflammatory effects when combined with selenium and lycopene . In randomized trials, patients with LUTS had greater improvement in International Prostate Symptom Scores (IPSS) and increased urine flow with this combination therapy in addition to tamsulosin than with either single therapy . The combination was also reported comparable to tadalafil for improving IPSS and urine flow .Due to the increased risk of normal tissue complications, patients should consult with a physician before using saw palmetto supplements during radiation therapy. Data on the effects of saw palmetto on symptom management during radiation therapy have yet to be published .",,"Studies with a liposterolic extract of saw palmetto berries showed that it reduced tissue uptake of both testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (DHT) by more than 40%, suggesting antiandrogenic activity (7). Further, the extract inhibited binding of DHT to its receptor (8) and blocked conversion of testosterone to DHT by inhibiting 5-alpha-reductase activity (9). The berries also inhibit cyclooxygenase and 5-lipoxygenase pathways, thereby preventing the biosynthesis of inflammation-producing prostaglandins and leukotrienes (10). Other possible mechanisms attributed to benefits in BPH include the blocking of estrogen receptor activity in the prostate as well as bladder muscle antispasmodic and anti-inflammatory activities (42). Possible mechanisms by which saw palmetto could cause hot flashes and vasomotor symptoms especially in children include its antiestrogenic activity influencing physiological endocrine activity and increased availability of sex hormone-binding globulin (35) (43).Studies of a hexanic extract of S. repens suggests it decreases prostaglandin and leukotriene production to inhibit the arachidonic acid cascade and decreases B lymphocyte infiltrates and interleukin (IL)-1b and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-a levels to adjust inflammatory status and gene expression (36). In animal models of prostate hyperplasia, it demonstrated a global anti-inflammatory effect on hyperplastic prostates with lobe-specific anti-androgenic effects (44). In human prostate and vascular cells in an inflammatory environment, it also decreases monocyte chemotactic protein-1 production and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 expression (37). In human prostate carcinoma cells, inhibitory effects on cell growth were attributed to downregulation of inflammatory-related genes and activation of nuclear factor-kappa B pathway (45).A chalcanonol glycoside from the seeds of saw palmetto as well as sterolic derivatives have demonstrated antiproliferative effects (46).",Fruit,American dwarf palm tree | Cabbage palm,Serenoa repens,Saw Palmetto,Saw Palmetto,

DSI000002,Selenium,C0521939,"Selenium, an essential dietary trace mineral, is an important component of cellular antioxidant defense systems that include enzymes such as glutathione peroxidase . It also plays an important role in thyroid function. Selenium can be obtained from the diet by consuming whole grains, meats, seafood, poultry, and nuts. It is sold in supplemental form to boost immune function and for disease prevention. Studies on the role of selenium in reducing cardiovascular disease risk are inconclusive , although a meta-analysis suggests benefit with antioxidant mixtures when they contain selenium . Data are also mixed on whether supplementation can reduce viral load in patients with HIV . Although it may improve glucose metabolism and reduce markers of inflammation and oxidative stress , supplementation is not useful in preventing diabetes and in some cases may increase the risk . Selenium alone or in combination with vitamin E also did not prevent dementia . In studies on the relationship between selenium and cancer prevention, data suggest it may help prevent gastrointestinal and lung cancers, although findings from bladder cancer research are conflicting . Other studies on whether selenium status impacts cancer risk are also mixed , and a review of RCTs did not find clear evidence of cancer preventive potential . In addition, the Selenium and Vitamin E Cancer Prevention Trial (SELECT) failed to find protective effects against prostate cancer or colorectal adenomas . In other studies, selenium along with soy and vitamin E did not prevent prostate cancer progression , and selenium taken with lycopene did not modulate prostate cancer risk . Moreover, selenium levels may influence the risk of aggressive prostate cancer , and supplementation may increase prostate cancer mortality . A chemoprevention trial of selenium in patients with non-small cell lung cancer did not show benefit, but did suggest a possible nonsignificant increase in secondary lung cancers . Long-term supplementation may increase the risk for certain types of skin cancer as well . With respect to dietary intake, no association between dietary selenium and thyroid cancer incidence was found . A few studies suggest selenium supplementation may reduce some cancer treatment side effects including hair loss, abdominal pain, loss of appetite , diarrhea , fatigue and nausea , head and neck lymphedema , and salivary gland damage . However, more studies are needed and supplementation in patients with low levels or during active treatment should be under the guidance of healthcare practitioners in cancer populations.",,"Selenium is an essential structural element of the antioxidant enzyme glutathione-peroxidase that converts aggressive oxidation products and intracellular free radicals into less reactive or neutral components (3). Other biological functions of selenium include regulation of thyroid hormone action and regulation of the reduction status of vitamin C (2).
In lab studies, selenium protected against adriamycin-induced cardiac dysfunction via restoring ATP-sensitive potassium channel expression (34). It induced a multitargeted cell death process characterized by unfolded protein response, ER-stress, and occurrence of large cytoplasmic vacuoles in addition to ROS formation (31). However, excessive selenium intake induces hepatic insulin resistance through an opposite regulation of ROS (32). The effects of dietary selenium on progression of malignant mesothelioma tumors depend on arising cancer cell redox metabolism and tumor ability to benefit from increased selenium intake (33).","Sodium selenate | Seafood, poultry, meat, whole grains, and nuts",Selenocysteine | Selenomethionine | Selenate | Selenite,Selenium,Selenium | Selenium nitrate | Selenium Picolinate,Selenium,

DSI000006,Zinc,C3541396,"Zinc is an essential element necessary for human physiologic functions including enzymatic reactions, bone formation, and regulation of synaptic signaling. It is thought to have antioxidant and immunostimulant activities, and is used as a dietary supplement to treat the common cold, diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, warts, and male infertility. Zinc is also an ingredient in some over-the-counter products such as topical creams and denture adhesives. Zinc sulfate is the most studied supplement, but other forms such as gluconate are also marketed for their higher absorption. Zinc deficiency is relatively rare in the United States, and more common in developing countries, in patients with various health conditions, and in those who habitually consume vegetarian diets . Deficiency has been linked to various chronic ailments , increased mortality , and infertility , but supplementation in men planning infertility treatment did not improve semen quality or live birth rates . Studies on whether short-term use of zinc lozenges can help reduce common cold symptoms are mixed . Data from clinical trials suggest supplementation may reduce duration but not severity of cold symptoms if taken within 24 hours of onset . In certain pediatric populations, zinc supplementation may help reduce respiratory tract infections or diarrhea . However, study results among children with cystic fibrosis are mixed , and a Cochrane review cites a lack of corresponding reduction in required intravenous antibiotics . Zinc supplementation also had a negative treatment effect in severe pediatric bacterial pneumonia, causing significantly longer hospital stays and slower recovery . Other studies report that zinc supplementation may reduce markers of insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome in children . In the elderly, zinc supplementation increased serum concentrations and was associated with enhanced T-cell function . However, high-dose zinc with or without high-dose ascorbic acid did not reduce COVID symptoms among ambulatory adult patients . Zinc supplementation was also ineffective against rheumatoid arthritis, and serum concentrations can actually be higher in patients with RA than in healthy individuals . Among HIV-positive adults with heavy alcohol use, zinc supplementation did not reduce mortality or cardiovascular disease risks . Animal models and human studies have linked zinc deficiency to an increased risk of developing esophageal squamous cell carcinoma while both deficiency and excess intake (more than 100 mg/day) were linked to prostate cancer . However, zinc >15 mg/day for 10 years may reduce risk of advanced prostate cancer . At the same time, epidemiological studies illustrate a relationship between high zinc levels in breast tissue and breast cancer . Taken together, research suggests that optimal zinc intake plays a role in achieving protective effects. Zinc may help manage some symptoms associated with cancer treatments, but evidence is mixed. Small studies suggest it may help reduce infection or fatigue in some patients undergoing chemotherapy . Supplementation was reported to reduce mucositis in some patients receiving radiation or chemotherapy , but not in head and neck cancer patients . Data are also mixed on whether it can help in taste preservation or improve survival . A meta-analysis suggests that overall, zinc-based therapy may reduce incidence of radiation-induced dysgeusia, but have minimal effects against ongoing symptoms .",,"Zinc is a component of many proteins and performs a number of catalytic, structural, and regulatory functions. It is essential for the structural formation of biologically active molecules such as copper-zinc superoxide dismutase (Cu/Zn SOD), and enzymes including RNA polymerases, alcohol dehydrogenase, carbonic anhydrase, and alkaline phosphatase that depend on zinc as a cofactor (26) (45) (46). Zinc influences protein kinase C activity, immunocompetence, apoptosis, and metallothionein levels and has a number of antioxidant and antiinflammatory functions (9) (16) (45) (47) (48). However, whether zinc elicits antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, or antiapoptotic effects is concentration-dependent and relies on an intricate balance. Under conditions of zinc overload or deficiency, zinc ions become pro-oxidant, proinflammatory, and proapoptotic (46).
The role of zinc in taste perception likely relates to the presence of alkaline phosphatase within the taste-bud membrane (49). Zinc accumulation in bone tissue activates alkaline phosphatase and stimulates collagen synthesis in osteoblasts, which are involved in bone mineralization and calcification (50). Zinc has the ability to complex with viral coat proteins, altering assembly of viral particles (51), and its deficiency increases humoral and cell-mediated immunity dysfunction and susceptibility to infection (47). Supplemental zinc can reduce the ability of the rhinovirus to attach to the human respiratory tract (6). In patients with a common cold, zinc decreases plasma soluble interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (sIL-1fa) and soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (sICAM-1), a cellular receptor for rhinovirus (4). In men with reduced sperm motility, zinc supplementation reduces oxidative stress, apoptosis, and sperm DNA fragmentation (27).
Zinc works with metallothioneins, Cu/Zn SOD, and p53 to combat oxidative stress and mediate DNA damage response and repair (52) (53). In vitro, intracellular zinc accumulation inhibits proliferation of human prostate cancer cells by causing G2/M arrest and upregulating CDKN1A gene expression, which expresses p21 (54) (55). Further, zinc deficiency depresses nuclear p21 and p53 levels (56). Animal models of esophageal cancer demonstrate that zinc-deficiency induces overexpression of proinflammatory mediators S100a8 and S100a9 as well as chemokines, chemokine receptors, cytokines, and Cox-2 (32) (33). Zinc replenishment reduces and also reverses these proinflammatory signatures (33).
Zinc dyshomeostasis has been implicated in breast cancer as a modulator of oxidative stress, DNA damage response/repair pathways, and cell proliferation/apoptosis (52). A diverse group of zinc transporters other than those associated with breast cancer play a role in regulating cell proliferation and apoptosis in prostate, pancreatic and ovarian cancers, suggesting zinc dysregulation in cancer is cell-type specific (52) (53) (54) (57).","Zinc oxide | Meats, fish, poultry, legumes, and whole grains",Zinc gluconate | Zinc sulfate | Zinc acetate | Zinc picolinate,Zinc | Zinc Bisglycinate,Zinc osporotate | Zinc,Zinc,
DSI000007,2-amino-2-deoxy-D-glucose,C0017718,"Glucosamine is an aminomonosaccharide synthesized from glucose. It is found in the cartilage and fluid around the joints as well as in marine invertebrate exoskeletons. Glucosamine has anti-inflammatory effects, and is marketed as a dietary supplement and often paired with chondroitin sulfate for joint health.Glucosamine has been mostly studied for osteoarthritis (OA). Although glucosamine/chondroitin supplementation was comparable to celecoxib in a large multicenter trial of patients with severe knee OA pain , and reduced circulating inflammatory cytokine IL-6 , other studies have not found benefit with glucosamine, chondroitin, or the combination for knee or hip OA . Data on chondroitin alone also suggest no significant benefit . In addition, no efficacy was seen with glucosamine for back pain , degenerative lumbar OA , or improving glucose metabolism in type 2 diabetes . Any benefits with glucosamine may be limited to older patients who have arthritis that is more severe or for longer periods of time .Meta-analyses of glucosamine trials are also mixed . The American College of Rheumatology conditionally recommends that patients avoid glucosamine for OA . In contrast, the European Society for Clinical and Economic Aspects of Osteoporosis and Osteoarthritis treatment guidelines recommend a prescription glucosamine formulation as being superior to other forms, but this product is not available in the US . It is further suggested that these differences in availability and formulas have contributed to the lack of significant effect across studies and pooled analyses . Additionally, interindividual differences in the absorption and elimination of glucosamine may cause variable clinical outcomes in OA according to a study of healthy adults .Clinical trials on whether glucosamine can improve temporomandibular joint symptoms are limited, providing low or no evidence of this effect although one study of oral glucosamine adjunctive to hyaluronic acid injection suggests long-term benefit . Preliminary studies of other combination treatments with glucosamine for various types of OA suggest improvements in pain and function , but more studies are needed to confirm these effects.Glucosamine has been assessed for its potential role against depression. Although preclinical studies suggested antidepressive effects, a clinical investigation failed to find any benefit .Exploratory findings suggest glucosamine may benefit gut health . Larger studies are needed to confirm these effects.Glucosamine/chondroitin supplementation has been correlated with reduction in cancer risk and mortality, although limitations such as bias could not be ruled out and confirmatory studies are needed .Glucosamine use has been associated with a higher risk for cardiovascular diseases in patients with osteoarthritis along with case reports of liver injury/toxicity . Patients on antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapies should be monitored for interactions or increased INR levels . Patients with poorly controlled diabetes or glucose intolerance should be monitored as glucosamine could worsen insulin resistance .",,"Progressive degeneration of cartilage glycosaminoglycans is evident in osteoarthritis. Glucosamine is the first step in glycosaminoglycan biosynthesis. In vitro, it increased production of monomeric proteoglycans capable of assembling into high molecular weight aggregates (26). Glucosamine can protect cartilage from metabolic impairment by NSAIDs, corticosteroids, and by exerting anti-inflammatory effects (27). It may promote cartilage repair by inducing tissue TGFβ1 and CTGF expression that regulates chondrocyte proliferation (28). Long-term reductions in TMJ symptoms with adjunctive oral glucosamine may be due to TGF-beta stimulation and IL-1beta / IL-6 suppression (42). Reduced systemic inflammation and cytokine activity found in a small randomized crossover study may explain potential reductions in mortality or cancer risk (30).Although glucosamine is slow to act (31), its effects may persist after treatment cessation (26).The rise in intraocular pressure associated with older patients in one study may relate to exogenous glycosaminoglycans effects on accumulations of extracellular matrix and thickening of the basement membrane, thereby compromising function of the trabecular meshwork (29).","Glucosamine sulfate potassium chloride | Prawn exoskeleton | Glucosamine hydrochloride | Glucosamine sulfate potassium chloride from shrimp exoskeleton | Aspergillus niger, chitin | Shellfish Chitin",Glucosamine sulphate | Glucosamine hydrochloride | Chitosamine,2-Amino-2-deoxy-D-glucose sulfate | 2-amino-2-deoxy-D-glucose sulfate | 2-Amino-2-deoxy-D-glucose hydrochloride | D-Glucosamine sulphate | Glucosamine | Glucosamine HCL | Sulfate de glucosamine chlorure de pottasium  provenant d?exosquelettes de crabes  | Sulfate de glucosamine chlorure de sodium  provenant d?exosquelettes de crevettes  | Chlorhydrate de glucosamine  | N-Acetyl-L-Glucosamine,Glucosamine (mixed type) | Glucosamine (mixed) | Glucosamine (unspecified),Glucosamine,

DSI000011,Vitamin A,C0087161,"Vitamin A is a group of nutrient compounds available from dietary sources including fruits, vegetables, eggs, dairy products, and fish. Vitamin A and its analogs such as beta-carotene, alpha-carotene, and cryptoxanthin are used as prescription drugs or dietary supplements to improve vision, skin conditions, immune function, growth and development in children, and to treat eczema and hepatitis C .In pediatric studies, supplementation appeared to benefit children , improve immune response to specific vaccines , reduce recurring urinary tract and parasitic infections , reduce clinical malaria episodes and improve plasma retinol levels in extremely preterm infants . However, other trials yielded conflicting data , and also do not support maternal or neonatal supplementation . In adults, preliminary findings suggest supplementation may inhibit progression of multiple sclerosis and improve fatigue and depression but evidence is lacking to support use of retinol-containing products to improve the appearance of aged skin .In oncology settings, some studies reported that late-stage breast cancer patients have lower serum vitamin A levels , and that diets richer in micronutrients including vitamin A can improve immune functioning and prognosis in head and neck cancer patients , and reduce the risk of oral and pharyngeal cancers . However, supplementation does not protect against non-small cell lung cancer or prolong survival for melanoma patients , and may actually elevate the risk of prostate cancer . Therefore it is best to obtain vitamin A from dietary sources, which can also protect against other chronic diseases. For instance, a meta-analysis found that having a diet rich in mixed carotenoids, which can then be converted to vitamin A in the body, benefits cardiometabolic health .Vitamin A is fat-soluble and supplement overuse may cause accumulation in the body. Doses greater than the recommended Daily Value of 5,000 IU or in conjunction with certain medications or pre-existing conditions may also result in adverse effects or toxicity . At the same time, vitamin A deficiency is the leading cause of preventable childhood blindness worldwide and often related to a lack of proper food access from poor socioeconomic status . Selective eating or restricted diet may also cause deficiencies and complications . In addition, a few cases of vitamin A deficiency-related retinopathy occurring years after abdominal surgeries have been possibly attributed to surgically-induced malabsorption: one related to multiple abdominal tumor resections , and another to bariatric surgery .",,"Vitamin A is essential for many aspects of ocular metabolism, including conjunctival and corneal epithelial maintenance, retinal phototransduction, and retinal pigment epithelial cell viability (33). Nuclear receptor transcription factors are central to vitamin A activity, and most transcriptional actions require the retinoic acid receptor/retinoid x receptor (RXR/RAR) heterodimer (34). Transcriptional changes are linked to epigenetic changes in histones and DNA via recruitment of epigenetic modifying enzymes (35).All-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) has been identified as the most important active metabolite in vitamin A for tissue homeostasis in adults and segmentation control in developing organisms (36). As such, retinoids that include ATRA along with natural and synthetic derivatives exhibit anticancer properties linked to their ability to induce cellular differentiation and growth suppression (35) (36).In animal models of melanoma, ATRA in combination with epigallocatechin-3-O-gallate (EGCG) from green tea enhanced 67-kDa laminin receptor expression and increased EGCG-induced cell growth inhibition (37). In estrogen receptor-negative breast cancer cells, ATRA halts telomerase activity and exerts antitumor effects via a rapid decrease of H3-K9 acetylation at the hTERT promoter (38). The protective effect of supplemental retinol against melanoma may be mediated by sunlight exposure (39).In multiple sclerosis patients, vitamin A supplementation as retinyl palmitate upregulated TGF-beta and FoxP3 gene expression (40) and decreased IFN-gamma and T-bet gene expression (41).Vitamin A competes with vitamin D for the same parathyroid hormone receptor (42).","Vitamin A palmitate | Preformed Vitamin A: Fortified and animal-based foods such as dairy products, liver, eggs, fishPro Vitamin A (beta-carotene): Carrots, sweet potato, cantaloupe, pumpkin, mango, papaya, dark leafy greens (9) (32)",Retinol | Retinal | Retinoic acid | Retinoid | Retinol palmitate,Vitamin A | Vitamin A aldehyde,Vitamin A (vitamin A cetate) | Vitamin A (retinol) | Vitamin A (retinyl not specified) | Vitamin A | Vitamin A (not specified) | Vitamin A (mixed) | Vitamin A (unspecified),Vitamin A,
DSI000012,Biotin,C0005575,"Biotin is an essential B vitamin that acts as an important coenzyme in carbohydrate and lipid metabolism. It is often taken alone or in combination with other vitamins for skin, nail, and hair health. It is also thought to benefit patients with diabetes and neuromuscular disorders. Biotin is abundant in foods including meat, vegetables, and eggs. True deficiency is rare but can be caused by a genetic disorder or malabsorption syndrome. Long-term use of certain anticonvulsant drugs can also induce biotin deficiency . These can be treated with supplementation. Low serum levels of biotin have been associated with hair loss in some women , but evidence on biotin for hair growth or strengthening brittle nails is limited . Although preliminary data found benefit with high-dose biotin for multiple sclerosis , a larger well-designed trial did not, but did find the potential for adverse consequences stemming from inaccurate lab test results . A review also cited insufficient evidence to support this use . Exploratory studies suggest biotin may benefit patients with severe diabetic peripheral neuropathy , and improve glycemic control when taken with chromium . Randomized trials are needed to validate these observations. Some case reports suggest biotin may help reduce chemotherapy-related skin rash , but overall evidence is lacking to support its use for dermatological disorders . Cases of inaccurate diagnostic test results have been linked to biotin supplement consumption. The American Association of Clinical Chemistry has issued a guidance document to help identify and address biotin interference in lab testing , and newer-generation assays now prevent biotin interference for hsTnT and TSH testing .",,"Biotin is an essential component in carbohydrate and lipid metabolism. It is converted to the free active form by the enzyme biotinidase (1).
Studies have shown that biotin induces microtubule formation in neurons (7), and deficiency slows myelination (8), which may result in neuropathy.

DSI000014,Folate,C0178638,"Folate is an essential member of the vitamin B complex family that is naturally present in grains, green leafy vegetables, and liver. Folic acid and the L-methylfolate derivative are synthetic supplemental forms that have higher bioavailability . Folate is important for cell growth and division, and is involved in methylation and DNA synthesis. Inadequate intake can cause deficiency leading to megaloblastic anemia. Folate is essential during pregnancy, with supplementation shown to reduce risks of neural tube birth defects and medulloblastoma in offspring . A study among South American populations suggests the protective effect against neural tube defects may be greater in female than male infants . In high doses (5 mg/day), it reduced homocysteine levels at time of delivery and may lessen pregnancy complications . Supplementation may also benefit women with polycystic ovary syndrome along with improving BMI , but supplements taken beyond the first trimester did not prevent pre-eclampsia in women at high risk for this disorder . In a large multicenter trial, folic acid and zinc supplementation by male partners of couples seeking infertility treatment did not improve semen quality or live birth rates . In postmenopausal women, folic acid may help reduce hot flushes, but confirmatory data are needed . In older adults, folic acid supplementation may improve cognitive function . In patients with Alzheimer’s disease, it improved response to cholinesterase inhibitors , cognition, and inflammatory markers . However, high folate / low vitamin B-12 status has been associated with impaired cognitive function in older adults . And although folic acid along with docosahexaenoic acid improved cognitive function and decreased plasma inflammatory cytokines better than each supplement alone in one study , other data suggest benefits with folic acid on cognitive function occur in those with a lower, rather than higher, omega-3 fatty acid status . But a combination of folic acid and vitamin-B12 did not affect the risk of fracture or cardiovascular disease in this population . Folic acid decreases homocysteine levels, a risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality , improves BMI in those with high homocysteine levels along with lowering blood pressure in smokers and in patients with CVD and overweight individuals . A combination of folic acid and vitamin B12 supplements also decreased homocysteine levels and improved anemia in patients with multiple sclerosis , but evidence is limited on whether supplementation has an effect on anemia in patients with sickle cell disease . Among hypertensive adults, folic acid therapy reduced risk of first stroke , but smoking status may affect efficacy . Other trials on stroke risk have yielded mixed results with meta-analyses confirming reductions in the risks of cardiovascular disease and stroke . In other studies, folate lowered blood arsenic concentrations of chronically exposed individuals by facilitating its urinary excretion . It was also associated with lower risk of progression of early-to-late age-related macular degeneration and when added to antipsychotics, may improve symptoms in schizophrenic patients , but did not have any significant effects on memory . Studies of folate vs cancer risk are mixed. Deficiency has been linked to development of esophageal squamous cell cancer and low levels of folate in the blood with certain forms of cancer , whereas higher levels of dietary folate may reduce the risk of breast and pancreatic cancers , but not prostate cancer . Folate supplementation may help cervical intraepithelial neoplasia regression , but studies on colorectal cancer risk produced mixed results and some even suggest a negative effect . A large population study suggested an association between dietary folate intake and increased risk for overall skin cancer, basal cell carcinoma, and non-melanoma skin cancer, particularly in women . Over-consumption of folic acid supplements may also increase risk of toxicity and some cancers . In young children, folic acid fortification was associated with reduced incidence of Wilms tumor and primitive neuroectodermal tumors . Studies of folic acid in combination with other B vitamins reported negative findings, with no overall effect on breast or invasive cancers , along with the potential for increased cancer incidence and mortality in patients with ischemic heart disease . Such interventions have also produced mixed results in studies for older adults with depression , and did not improve bone mineral density or reduce fracture risk or incidence . Further studies are needed for more definitive data. Due to its antagonistic effects, folic acid can reduce the side effects of methotrexate when used for rheumatoid arthritis . However, it may decrease the efficacy of methotrexate in the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia and psoriasis . Excess folate or folic acid may mask vitamin B12 deficiency . More research is needed to address the evidence and knowledge gaps related to the effects of higher intake of folate/folic acid on human health .",,"Folate acts as a co-enzyme during methylation. The bioactive form is tetrahydrofate, which can be converted from folic acid through the action of dihydrofolate reductase. Drugs that inhibit this enzyme can therefore reduce folic acid activity. The amino acid serine reacts with tetrahydrofolate, resulting in 5,10- methylenetetrahydrofolate, the derivative involved in nucleotide synthesis. In addition, 5-methyltetrahydrofolate transfers a methyl group to cobalamin (vitamin B12) and then to homocysteine, converting it to methionine, the precursor of methyl donor, S-adenosyl-methionine (SAM-e) that plays a major role in neurological function and several biochemical pathways (41). Genetic polymorphisms that lower the production of methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase can also reduce SAM-e and increase homocysteine levels. Supplementation with folic acid can therefore reduce homocysteine levels and DNA oxidative damage (57) (58). This may in turn lower risk of cardiovascular and psychiatric diseases by increasing SAM-e (59) (60). Folic acid supplementation also improves endothelial function (16) (31); and has a protective effect on retinal vascular endothelial cells from high glucose-induced injury via regulating proteins in the Hippo signaling pathway (76).
Although low folate status is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease and some cancers (61), increased intake from fortified foods may actually raise cancer risk (49) (50) (62). There is also evidence that high levels of unmetabolized folic acid in plasma can reduce natural killer cell cytotoxicity (63).","Folate | Main sources include fortified breakfast cereals and breads, liver, Brussels sprouts, potatoes, spinach, chickpeas, and brewer’s yeast.",Folic acid | Vitamin B9,Folate,Folate,Folate,

DSI000016,Niacinamide,C0028027,"Nicotinamide, also known as niacinamide, is a water-soluble amide form of niacin or vitamin B3. It is found in foods such as fish, poultry, eggs, and cereal grains. It is also marketed as a dietary supplement, and as a non-flushing form of niacin. Nicotinamide has established medical uses to treat conditions stemming from niacin deficiency such as pellagra. Oral and topical formulations are used to treat a variety of inflammatory skin conditions including acne vulgaris and rosacea , hyperpigmentation and to prevent hair thinning . Preclinical models demonstrate photoimmunoprotective and chemopreventive effects against UV radiation . Nicotinamide enhances repair of UV radiation-induced DNA damage in human melanocytes and keratinocytes and similar effects have been demonstrated in human studies . It was also shown to improve inner retinal and visual function in patients treated for glaucoma. Other clinical trials show oral nicotinamide reduces UV-induced and photodynamic therapy (PDT)-induced immunosuppression. In patients with sun-damaged skin, oral nicotinamide helped prevent the occurrence of nonaggressive skin cancers . In a small trial among renal transplant patients however, similar effects were not significant . Other studies found a reduction in actinic keratoses, a predictor of melanoma risk , and a meta-analysis reported association with significant reductions in basal cell and squamous cell carcinomas, but increased risk of digestive adverse events . Additional studies are warranted . Nicotinamide appears to be largely well tolerated in clinical studies . Even though niacin is converted into nicotinamide in the body , these two supplements should not be viewed as interchangeable as they have different side effect profiles .",,"Nicotinamide is chemically part of the coenzymes nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide NAD+ and NADH (1), used in oxidation-reduction reactions in the body. Among these activities is the production of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) (11), which fuels cellular metabolic activities.
Photoimmunoprotective effects of oral or topical nicotinamide are linked to its support for DNA repair by preventing post-UV exposure declines in cellular energy or the repletion of energy to irradiated cells (4) (13). Its influence on several pathways contribute to this enhanced repair of UV-induced DNA damage (16). Skin cancer chemoprevention is attributed in part to reductions in inflammatory macrophages (22). In UV-irradiated keratinocytes, nicotinamide reduced expression of IL-6, IL-10, MCP-1 and TNF-alpha mRNA, cytokine mediators whose activity may be involved in inflammation, cellular-tissue injury, cell death, and skin cancer (17). In human melanocytes, nicotinamide increased the global nucleotide excision repair rate and number of irradiated melanocytes undergoing DNA repair (5).
Effects of topical nicotinamide on inflammatory skin conditions are attributed to its sebosuppressive and anti-inflammatory properties (1).
Although niacin and nicotinamide are considered similar in their role as vitamins, their pharmacologic indications, effects, and side effects are different. Niacin has high affinity to a G-protein-coupled receptor HM74A in human cells resulting in the releasing of prostaglandins that cause vasodilation or flushing of the skin. It also lowers cholesterol (11) (18) .","Niacinamide | Niacinamide | Nicotinamide ascorbate | Niacinamide | Fish, poultry, eggs, nuts, legumes, beef, cereal grains, fortified foods; smaller amounts are also found in green vegetables.",Vitamin B3 | Niacinamide | Nicotinic acid amide | Nicotinic amide | Vitamin PP,Niacinamide | 3-Pyridinecarboxamide | Nicotinamide | Nicotinamidum,Nicotinamide Mononucleotide | Nicotinamide | Vitamin B3 (Niacinamide) | Vitamin B3 (nicotinamide),Nicotinamide,

DSI000020,Vitamin B12,C2936883,"Vitamin B12, part of the vitamin B-complex family, refers to the group of compounds that consists of cyanocobalamin, hydroxycobalamin, and related substances . It is essential for normal nerve function, DNA synthesis, hematopoiesis, fatty acid metabolism, and amino acid synthesis in the mitochondria. It also plays an important role in homocysteine metabolism. Vitamin B12 is abundant in diets that include meat and dairy products, although deficiency can occur in those with malabsorption syndromes or those who take medications for gastric disorders , for conditions associated with insulin resistance , or in those who follow a strict vegetarian diet . B12 deficiency is also more common among the elderly . Lack of B12 can lead to a wide variety of hematologic, neurologic, and psychiatric disorders, may increase the risk of cardiovascular disease , and cause pseudo-thrombotic microangiopathy following gastrectomy . Vitamin B12 is often included in vitamin products used to reduce homocysteine, which is associated with cardiovascular diseases. High dietary intakes of B vitamins including B12 have been associated with a decreased risk for cataracts . However, combined supplementation with B12, B6, and folic acid may increase the risk of cataract extraction . Although low serum B12 levels have been associated with increased bone turnover and fracture risk , long-term B12 and folic acid supplementation did not improve bone mineral density , or reduce osteoporotic fracture incidence in elderly individuals with elevated plasma homocysteine levels . Repletion of vitamin B12 may improve response in patients resistant to antidepressants , and in older adults with major depression, long-term supplementation with a combination of B12, B6, and folic acid enhanced antidepressant treatment efficacy . However, such combined supplementation did not reduce depression risk among middle-age and older women despite significant reductions in homocysteine levels . Homocysteine-lowering therapy may have some cardiovascular benefits following coronary interventions , but does not appear to lower risk of further cardiovascular events including stroke . In addition, increased risk of in-stent restenosis with such treatment has been reported in patients after coronary stenting . Long-term B12 and folic acid supplementation also had no effect on arterial stiffness and atherosclerosis in elderly patients with hyperhomocysteinemia , and a meta-analysis suggests that evidence for cardiovascular preventive benefits with B-vitamins is lacking . In other studies, B12 did not improve cognitive function , but may positively affect gait and physical performance in the elderly , or reduce analgesic use in patients with postherpetic neuralgia . Studies of B vitamin supplementation for cancer prevention are also mixed , and long-term supplementation may actually increase risk for lung or colorectal cancers . Preliminary data suggest B12 supplementation may help reduce pain and improve quality of life in patients with aromatase inhibitor-associated musculoskeletal symptoms . However, individual B12 or iron supplement use during chemotherapy may be significantly associated with poorer outcomes . Additional studies are needed to elucidate these findings.",,"Vitamin B12 is involved in the transfer of methyl groups, and in methylation reactions essential for the synthesis of phospholipids and neurotransmitters in the central nervous system. It is also required for synthesis of nucleic acid, notably DNA, the metabolism of fatty acids and amino acids in the mitochondria, and in delivering SAMe, the universal methyl donor (16) (30). In humans, two enzymatic reactions dependent on B12 are produced and activated in separate cellular compartments: methylcobalamin in the cytosol and adenosylcobalamin in the mitochondria (1). As a coenzyme in methyl transfer reactions, B12 converts homocysteine to methionine, and participates in L-methylmalonyl-coenzyme A (CoA) conversion to succinyl-CoA (8). In the first enzyme reaction, methylcobalamin is used to recycle the folate cofactor 5-methyltetrahydrofolate to tetrahydrofolate thereby allowing the folate cofactor to participate in a cycle involving the biosynthesis of purines and pyrimidines. During this reaction, homocysteine is converted to methionine yielding the methyl groups required for methylation that is essential in biosynthesis (31).
When used with pemetrexed, B12/folic acid therapy further increases sub-G1 populations in human adenocarcinoma and large-cell carcinoma cell lines, independent of p53 status (28).","Vitamin B12 |

DSI000021,Vitamin B6,C0034272,"Vitamin B6 or pyridoxine, as part of the water-soluble vitamin B-complex family, is actually a mixture of 6 inter-convertible pyridine vitamers, or related compounds: pyridoxine, pyridoxamine, pyridoxal, and their 5′-phosphorylated forms . Although plants and microorganisms can synthesize B6 on their own, humans must acquire it from dietary sources. Because vitamin B6 is abundant in meats, fish, poultry, shellfish, leafy green vegetables, legumes, fruits, and whole grains, deficiencies are rare. For example, patients taking the antituberculosis drug isoniazide need to take vitamin B6 to prevent drug-induced peripheral neuropathy. Patients may use supplemental B6 to treat symptoms related to heart disease, hypertension, peripheral neuropathies, carpal tunnel syndrome, and diabetes.Preclinical studies show that systemic administration of certain B vitamins including B6 has neuroprotective, antihypertensive , antinociceptive , and antitumor effects . In humans, higher B6 intake may lower serum homocysteine concentrations and decrease risk of progression to late age related macular degeneration but did not reduce the risk of developing type 2 diabetes . A systematic review determined that B6 may be useful in treating neuropsychiatric adverse effects associated with the antiepileptic drug Levetiracetam . High dietary intakes of folate and B6 have been associated with reduced risk of mortality from stroke, coronary heart disease, and heart failure . Intake of B6 has also inversely associated with metabolic syndrome . In older adults with mild cognitive impairment taking aspirin, B6 had favorable effects on global cognitive functioning .Studies suggest dietary intake of vitamin B6 may reduce risk for colorectal and pancreatic cancers , and lower intakes are associated with increased risk of some gastrointestinal cancers . Dietary B6 may also reduce risk of ovarian cancer and all cancers, although this may occur because of the many other micronutrients that are also ingested .Getting B6 through supplements is not associated with the same positive effects on disease risk. Conclusions from the Women’s Health Study indicate that supplementation with B6, B12, and folate did not decrease breast cancer risk , nor did it have an effect on overall risk of invasive cancer or breast cancer . Long-term supplementation was also associated with increased risk of lung cancer, especially in male smokers .Although vitamin B6 has been used empirically to prevent or treat chemotherapy-associated hand-foot syndrome (HFS), several randomized trials did not find benefit . But higher doses may have benefit . In one study, it did reduce the need for capecitabine dose modifications and incidence of severe HFS, but did not positively impact chemotherapy effects .High intakes of vitamin B6 can have toxic effects including sensory and motor neuropathies, and some case reports of neurotoxicity have not been reversible . In addition, a secondary analysis among postmenopausal women in the Nurses’ Health Study found that combined high intakes of B6 and B12 were associated with an unexpected increased risk of hip fracture . Large quantities of vitamin B6 should also be avoided in women who are pregnant or of childbearing potential .",,"Vitamin B6 is a coenzyme in the folate metabolism pathway. Its phosphorylated metabolites are involved in amino acid metabolism, the transsulfuration pathway of homocysteine to cysteine, and glycogen phosphorylase activity which mobilizes glucose from glycogen (32). It is a cofactor along with cystathionine b synthase and cystathionase to produce cysteine and glutathione from their precursor homocysteine (33). Pyridoxal phosphate (PLP) is the major coenzyme form, the most abundant in animal tissue, and the cofactor for over 100 enzymes used in amino acid metabolism, including aminotransferases, decarboxylases, racemases, and dehydrases. It also facilitates mobilization of glucose units from glycogen via glycogen phosphorylase (32). PLP is also the active antiemetic form of B6, of which pyridoxine and pyridoxal have been identified as prodrugs (45).In animal models, an excess-pyridoxine diet actively influenced cell-mediated immunity via enhanced IFN-γ production and Th1-polarization (34). In several cancer cell lines, B6 contributed to increased p21 gene expression via p53 activation (4). Proposed mechanisms for an inverse relationship of B6 intake and serum PLP with cancer risk include: 1) its participation in one-carbon metabolism that is essential for DNA synthesis, repair, and methylation; 2) the high uracil and chromosome breaks caused by B6 deficiency which may interfere with these processes leading to aberrant gene expression, DNA instability, and eventual disease; and 3) possible cancer-suppression effects through reductions in cell proliferation, angiogenesis, oxidative stress, inflammation, and nitric oxide synthesis (16) (21).At the same time, because PLP is the metabolically active form of B6, it is thought to be responsible for instances of vitamin B6 toxicity (29). High circulating pyridoxine levels may have direct toxic effects on peripheral sensory ganglia neurons in the lower blood–nerve barrier, whereas the blood–brain barrier protects neurons in those regions from higher levels (35). The negative impact of B6 upon levels of other B vitamins appears to be dose-dependent and occur with chronic exposure (29).","Pyridoxine hydrochloride | Pyridoxine hydrochloride | Pyridoxine hydrochloride | Meats, fish, shellfish, poultry, leafy green vegetables, legumes, fruits, and whole grains (5) (30) (31)",Pyridoxine | Pyridoxal | Pyridoxamine | Pyridoxic acid,"Vitamin B6 | Pyridoxinum hydrochloricum | Pyridoxine | 5-Hydroxy-6-methyl-3,4-pyridinedimethanol",Pyridoxine (Vitamin B6) | Vitamin B6 (pyridoxal) | Vitamin B6 (Mixed) | Vitamin B6 | Vitamin B6 (Pyridoxine HCl) | Vitamin B6 (not specified) | Vitamin B6 (unspecified) | Vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) | Vitamin B6 (various),Vitamin B6,
DSI000022,Vitamin D,C3537249,"Vitamin D refers to several forms of fat-soluble vitamins found in fortified milk and cereals, egg yolks, and fish. The two forms utilized in humans are ergocalciferol (D2) and cholecalciferol (D3). Sunlight can promote the synthesis of D3 in the skin. Vitamin D maintains serum calcium and phosphorus levels by regulating their absorption and excretion, and is important for bone formation. Other biologic functions include its role as an antiproliferative agent , and as a pro-differentiation hormone with anti-inflammatory and immunoregulatory properties . Low levels of vitamin D are associated with a greater risk of mortality , may affect cardiovascular health , and increase the risk for development of multiple sclerosis in women , but a large study found no association between lower levels and cognitive function . However, deficiency during pregnancy may affect neurocognitive development in newborns . Deficiency can also cause rickets or other bone disorders, and may be a risk factor for extraskeletal diseases . Lower D levels may occur due to time of year or living in northern climates ; in non-Caucasian race or obese individuals ; with chronic use of steroids or anticonvulsants; or with diseases such as autoimmune disorders , cystic fibrosis , kidney disease, and cancer .Although some studies suggest vitamin D improves bone mineral density and prevents fractures in the elderly and in postmenopausal women , it did not lower risk of fractures in midlife and older adults or improve lower extremity function and was associated with an increased fall risk in older adults . Safety concerns also arose with doses of 1000 IU/d or higher in older persons who had elevated fall risk and low serum D levels but conflicting findings do not support such concerns . Data are also conflicting for primary fracture prevention in other populations , and a meta-analysis did not find benefit for preventing fractures or falls, or for bone mineral density . In healthy adults, D3 also does not appear to decrease fall risk and high-dose supplementation did not benefit bone health , with 4000 or 10,000 IU compared with 400 IU resulting in greater bone mineral density loss in healthy vitamin D-sufficient women, but not men . Supplementation did not affect the rate of frailty change or incidence over time in healthy community-dwelling older adults , and US Preventive Services Task Force reports also found no associations between supplementation and reduced falls or fracture incidence in this subset . Another study failed to find associations between vitamin D status and chronic pain .Findings on whether vitamin D protects against cardiovascular (CV) risk factors have varied across populations and regimens. In a Women’s Health Initiative sub-study, calcium plus vitamin D and hormone therapy had a greater effect than either intervention alone or placebo , but vitamin D did not improve CV risk factors or physical function in large long-term trials of older adults or reduce all-cause mortality in older adults who are vitamin D-replete . Meta-analyses also found no effect on vascular function markers nor reduction in CV disease endpoints . Yet in another placebo-controlled trial, supplementation benefited diabetic patients with coronary artery disease who were vitamin D-deficient . In addition, a single large dose of vitamin D2 improved endothelial function in type-2 diabetic patients . In non-dialysis patients with chronic kidney disease, D3 was more effective than D2 in raising serum D levels . Dietary vitamin D intake was shown to be inversely associated with mortality from stroke , but supplementation was not associated with reduced all-cause mortality in critically ill patients , and did not reduce risk of atrial fibrillation .In other trials, vitamin D did not significantly reduce upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs) in healthy adults , or infections/antibiotic use in the elderly . However, it may protect against influenza and reduce wheezing in some infants . Vitamin D was not helpful for mild psoriasis or seasonal affective disorder . Supplementation may reduce relapse risk in Crohn’s disease , and D3 plus calcium may have a small effect on postmenopausal weight gain . A single oral high-dose of D3 significantly improved fatigue in healthy persons who were vitamin D-deficient . Supplementation may also improve sexual function in women with sexual dysfunction and vitamin D deficiency , but a large study did not find any benefits of long-term supplementation for preventing depression in healthy adults . In a small study, higher serum levels of vitamin D were associated with increased beneficial gut bacteria and decreased pathogenic bacteria .In pediatric trials, vitamin D did not influence growth, body composition, or pubertal development , and did not prevent viral URTIs or tuberculosis . Vitamin D has also been examined for its anticancer potential. In animal models, dietary vitamin D3 exerted chemopreventive effects against breast cancer equivalent to those elicited by calcitriol without causing hypercalcemia . In humans, vitamin D from sunlight exposure and dietary intake may have protective effects against breast cancer , and insufficiency among breast cancer patients is high . In postmenopausal women not on estrogen therapy, vitamin D and calcium supplementation may reduce colorectal cancer incidence . In women with grade 1 cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, long-term supplementation resulted in regression and improved metabolic status . However, in a large trial of healthy postmenopausal women with mean vitamin D levels above those of the US population, taking vitamin D3 plus calcium did not lower cancer risk after 4 years of supplementation , and vitamin D supplementation did not prevent aromatase-induced arthralgia or affect cognition when combined with calcium, protein and a multicomponent exercise training in men treated with ADT for prostate cancer . In addition, even though pooled analyses found associations between higher serum D levels and lower risks of breast and colon cancers , other analyses have not found preventive effects against cancer with high-dose supplementation , and contributing factors such as better diet and lifestyle habits may also be at play.In older patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, supplementation normalized vitamin D levels and enhanced efficacy of rituximab . Active vitamin D compounds may also decrease incidence of post-transplant malignancy among kidney transplant recipients .Other data reveal that vitamin D deficiency is highly prevalent in advanced pancreatic cancer and colorectal cancer (CRC) patients , and that CRC patients with higher blood 25(OH)D concentrations have better survival . A meta-analysis of vitamin D supplementation on CRC survival outcomes also suggests clinically meaningful benefit . In patients with metastatic CRC, addition of high-dose vitamin D3 to chemotherapy resulted in statistically insignificant progression-free survival but improved supportive hazard ratio . Increased vitamin D intake reduced CRC risk , but had no effect on colorectal adenomas . Data on benefits to reduce skin cancer risk and advanced cancers are mixed. Vitamin D did not have a protective effect against non-Hodgkin lymphoma , ovarian , kidney , endometrial , esophageal or gastric cancers, may significantly increase risk of pancreatic or aggressive prostate cancer , and did not improve relapse-free survival in patients with digestive tract cancers although conflicting findings in p53 immunoreactive subset suggest otherwise . Data from meta-analyses, however, are conflicting on whether vitamin D supplementation can reduce cancer incidence or mortality .Oral supplementation has been shown to be the safest way to increase vitamin D levels , although debate continues on how this may translate to optimizing vitamin D status . The Institute of Medicine recommends a Daily Dietary Allowance of vitamin D at 600 IU/day with the Upper Level Intake at 4,000 IU/day for bone health , although safety concerns have been noted with higher doses in some populations . Also, combined vitamin D and calcium supplementation has been associated with increased kidney stone incidence . Therefore, patients should consult with their physicians if a deficiency is suspected to assess the amount of vitamin D needed for health maintenance and to avoid side effects.",,"The most biologically active metabolite of vitamin D is calcitriol, which regulates calcium and phosphate homeostasis (52). In humans, the primary function of vitamin D is to maintain normal levels of serum calcium and phosphorus concentrations by enhancing small intestine dietary absorption efficiency of these minerals. 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] enhances the efficiency of calcium and phosphorus absorption along the entire small intestine, but primarily in the duodenum and jejunum (5). When dietary calcium intake is insufficient, 25(OH)D and parathyroid hormone (PTH) mobilize monocytic stem cells in the bone marrow to become mature osteoclasts. These osteoclasts mobilize calcium from the bones, thereby maintaining blood calcium levels (50). Vitamin D is thought to have physiological effects in other parts of the body as well because vitamin D receptors (VDRs) are found in the cells of other organs that include intestines, kidney, stomach, brain, prostate, breast, and white blood cells (2) (53).The anticancer effect of vitamin D is thought to be due to induction of cell differentiation (1) (54) and antiproliferation (55). In lymphoma cells, interventional 25(OH)D3 to normalize levels (>30 ng/mL) resulted in significantly stronger antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity, suggesting benefit in D-deficient individuals receiving rituximab (27). In xenograft models of breast cancer, dietary D3 elevated circulating D levels and increased CYP27B1 expression in both tumor and intestines, suggesting it stimulates local calcitriol synthesis in the tumor microenvironment and promotes the ensuing paracrine/autocrine actions that contribute to its anticancer activity (20). The upregulation of CYP27B1 expression by tumors was unique to D3 versus calcitriol in the same tissue (20). In other animal models, a positive feedback signaling loop between the serine-protein kinase ATM (ataxia telangiectasia mutated) and the VDR was identified as critical for cancer chemoprevention by vitamin D (56).Calcitriol, the hormonally active form of vitamin D3, targets the vitamin D degrading enzyme CYP24A1, which is most abundant in the kidney, but also expressed in several other tissues (57). CYP24A1 overexpression in colon, ovary, breast, lung, and esophageal malignancies, likely leads to degradation of the locally available D3, impairing its antitumorigenic action in the tumor tissue (57).","Cholecalciferol | Fatty fish, fish liver oils, egg yolks, fortified milk and cereals (5)",Vitamin D | Sunshine vitamin | D2; D3,Vitamin D,Vitamin D (mixed) | Vitamin D | Vitamin D (unspecified),Vitamin D,

DSI000041,Vitamin C,C2349136,"Vitamin C is a water-soluble vitamin that exists as either ascorbic acid or ascorbate. It is found in many fresh fruits and vegetables and is essential for a variety of physiologic functions. It is not synthesized in the human body, and deficiency can cause scurvy.Vitamin C is promoted as an antioxidant supplement to support immune health. Its effect on the common cold is generally minimal , and high-dose vitamin C alone or with high-dose zinc did not decrease SARS-CoV-2 symptoms . But supplementation in pregnant smokers improved respiratory health in the offspring .In large randomized trials, supplemental vitamin C did not reduce coronary heart disease risk . Further, it may increase risk of mortality and nonfatal myocardial infarction in patients with coronary artery disease .The role of vitamin C in cancer prevention is mixed .Although increased chemotherapy-associated adverse effects have been observed with inadequate vitamin C intake , there are also theories against the use of vitamin C supplements during treatment. Preclinical studies suggest cancer cells preferentially uptake vitamin C and render some chemotherapy drugs less effective . Also, a major concern with antioxidant use is potential interference with cancer treatments that rely on ROS production for their cytotoxic activities .Oral supplement studiesA few small trials suggest vitamin C along with other supplements may reduce some cancer therapy-induced side effects , but older trials in advanced cancer patients using 10 g per day of oral vitamin C did not yield significant benefit . This lack of effect may be explained by limited plasma concentrations reached via oral route in a pharmacokinetic study .Other small studies suggest supplementation does not reduce therapeutic effects of paclitaxel and carboplatin and may enhance effects of DNA methyl transferase inhibitors , but more studies are needed.Although adverse effects from vitamin C supplements are generally rare, there are reports of GI upset, kidney stone formation , and hemolytic anemia in patients with G6PDH deficiency . Patients with a history of oxalate kidney stones, renal insufficiency, hematochromatosis, or those undergoing chemotherapy should consult their physicians before taking vitamin C supplements.Intravenous high-dose studiesIntravenous high-dose vitamin C has been used as an alternative cancer treatment based on the hypothesis that formation of new collagen resists malignant infiltration . Higher pharmacologic concentrations had selective cytotoxic effects in cancer cell lines . Early reports of parenteral plus oral ascorbic acid showed promising results . High-dose IV ascorbic acid up to 1.5 g/kg/day or used with chemotherapy appears to be well-tolerated. Other preliminary data suggest various regimens may improve quality of life in terminal cancer patients and reduce chemotherapy-associated toxicity .However, high-dose IV vitamin C as an anticancer treatment should be considered an investigational drug used only in clinical trial settings, as it did not improve survival in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer , sepsis studies have not found benefit , and adverse events , and interference with glucometer readings have been reported.",,"Vitamin C is essential for the formation and polymerization of collagen, so its deficiency results in scurvy and poor wound healing (1). It also inhibits hyaluronidase leading to the hypothesis that it can prevent metastasis by strengthening collagen (45).Ascorbic acid acts as an antioxidant to protect against oxidative damage from free radicals (46). It inactivates nitric oxide, improves endothelium-dependent vasodilation (47), and acts via different mechanisms depending on its plasma concentration.Plasma concentrations <0.1 mM are achieved through oral intake of dietary or supplemental forms. At pharmacologic plasma concentrations of 0.3–20 mM via IV injection, ascorbic acid is oxidized to an ascorbate radical which acts as a prodrug for hydrogen peroxide formation within interstitial fluids (32) (33). This induces DNA damage and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) depletion, and triggers ataxia telangiectasia mutated/adenosine monophosphate–activated protein kinase and inhibition of mammalian target of rapamycin in cancer cells (67).Other preclinical data suggest ascorbate can regulate hematopoietic stem cell function and leukemogenesis (77). In leukemic cells, vitamin C compensated for Tet2 mutations to restore normal function (78). In non-small-cell lung cancer and glioblastoma cells, pharmacological ascorbate selectively sensitized these cells (79). Ascorbate decreases colon cancer cell proliferation by downregulating specificity proteins (48). It also depletes ATP and induces autophagy and cell death in prostate cancer cells (49). Preferential oxidative cytotoxic effects on cancer cells may be due to the presence of intracellular iron (50), copper (51), increased p53 activity (52), and overexpression of sodium-dependent vitamin C transporter 2 (53). High-dose vitamin C also appeared to suppress metastasis of breast cancer cells by inhibiting epithelial-mesenchymal transition (82).Dehydroascorbic acid, the oxidized form of vitamin C, may have cytoprotective effects by preserving mitochondrial membrane potential (38).","Vitamin C | Citrus fruits, fresh vegetables, berries, melons",Ascorbate | Sodium ascorbate | Ascorbic Acid,Vitamin C,Vitamin C (not specified) | Vitamin C (unspecified) | Vitamin C (mixed) | Vitamin C (ascorbic palmitate) | Vitamin C,Vitamin C,

DSI000045,Allium sativum,C0017102,"Derived from the bulb or clove of the plant, garlic is used as a spice and to treat hyperlipidemia, hypertension, atherosclerosis, cancer, and infections. Processing can have a substantial effect on the chemical content of garlic because the volatile oil components are heat-sensitive and certain enzymes are acid-labile. The best measure of total activity of garlic is its ability to produce allicin, which in turn, results in the formation of other active constituents . Studies are mixed on whether garlic preparations can lower cholesterol or blood pressure , but meta-analyses suggest reductions in cardiovascular risk factors . Studies on protective effects against various cancers are also mixed. In a large trial, long-term garlic supplementation was associated with reduced risk of gastric cancer mortality but not incidence , although conflicting data did not find evidence for either . Whether garlic protects against Helicobacter pylori infection is also unclear . Meta-analyses are also mixed on whether garlic intake reduces colorectal cancer risk . Inverse associations have been identified between garlic consumption and risk of endometrial , prostate , and other cancers . Garlic supplementation may also be associated with reduced risk of hematologic malignancies . Because garlic is known to decrease platelet aggregation and potentially elevate INR values, it should not be used with anticoagulants or in patients with platelet dysfunction .",,"Intact cells of garlic contain alliin, an odorless sulfur-containing amino acid derivative. When the cells are crushed, alliin comes into contact with the enzyme alliinase located in neighboring cells and is converted to allicin. Allicin has antibacterial and antimicrobial activity, but is highly odoriferous and unstable. It also has antiplatelet and antihyperlipidemic activities. Most authorities agree that the best measure of total activity of garlic is the ability to produce allicin, which, in turn, results in the formation of other active constituents (1).
In patients with hyperlipidemia, garlic might lower cholesterol levels by acting as an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor (21). Garlic may also reduce oxidative stress and LDL oxidation and have antithrombotic effects (22). It might reduce blood pressure by causing smooth muscle relaxation and vasodilation (23).
Garlic may stimulate both humoral and cellular immunity, causing T-cell proliferation, restoring suppressed antibody responses (24), and stimulating macrophage cytotoxicity on tumor cells. It may increase selenium absorption with possible protection against tumorigenesis (25). In addition, garlic may protect against certain cancers by halting cell cycle progression and inducing apoptosis of cancer cells as well as by decreasing angiogenesis and influencing carcinogen metabolism (26) (27).",Allium sativum - Bulb,Nectar of the gods | Camphor of the poor | Da-suan | La-suan | Stinking rose,Allium sativum,Bear Garlic | Garlic pear | Garlic,Garlic,

DSI000049,Omega-3 Fatty Acids,C0015689,"A type of polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) derived mainly from fish oil, omega-3 fatty acids are used as dietary supplements for depression, to lower cholesterol, and to reduce the risk of heart attack. A large survey of Finnish adults found that depressive symptoms were significantly higher among infrequent fish consumers and in other studies individuals with major depression had marked depletions in omega-3 . Supplementation, however, did not prevent depression , relieve depression in adults with major depression , including those with or at risk of coronary heart disease , with mild to moderate depression , with perinatal depression ; or in obese or overweight adults with subsyndromal depressive symptoms , and yielded mixed results in those with schizophrenia . In young adults at risk for psychotic conditions, supplementation reduced the risk of progression to psychiatric disorders and was a safe preventive measure in young adults although conflicting data show no benefit against major depressive disorder .Supplementation in pregnant women did not lower the incidence of early preterm delivery, nor the higher incidence of interventions in post-term deliveries , and did not improve cognitive or language outcomes in early childhood , or intelligence . But DHA was shown to improve learning and memory function in age-related cognitive decline although a large, long-term study of omega-3 with or without multidomain lifestyle interventions of physical activity, cognitive training, and nutritional advice failed to find significant effects on cognitive decline in elderly adults with memory complaints .Studies are mixed on the effects of supplementation on incidence or progression of age-related macular degeneration .Omega-3 lowers cholesterol and may reduce recurrence in patients with a history of stroke . In individuals with cardiovascular risk factors, supplementation improved cardiometabolic profiles , but did not prevent incident atrial fibrillation nor lower the risk of cardiovascular disease events although a meta analysis reported that protective effects of EPA and DHA increase with dosage . Omega-3 may also help patients with ulcerative colitis , but was ineffective in the treatment of Crohn’s disease . In adults with rheumatoid arthritis, supplementation led to reductions in NSAID use and in NSAID-associated gastroduodenal damage . It may also lower the magnitude of the body’s inflammatory response , and can reduce sensitivity to sunburn and to ultraviolet radiation . Reviews indicate possible benefits for patients with cystic fibrosis , but not in those with asthma . Fish oil may help reduce the symptoms of systemic lupus erythematosus . Another large trial also reported benefit, with or without vitamin D, in reducing the risk of autoimmune disease .In type 1 diabetic patients, long-term supplementation had positive effects on neuropathy, measured by increases in corneal nerve fiber length . But there was no significant benefit in patients with dry eye disease . A systematic review determined benefits of omega-3 on insulin sensitivity and adipocyte function . However, high-dose supplementation did not improve features associated with metabolic syndrome such as adipose tissue lipolysis or inflammation in insulin-resistant adults . In another trial, DHA was found more effective compared to eicosapentanoic acid (EPA) in modulating indicators of inflammation and blood lipids . In women with gestational diabetes, omega-3 and vitamin E improved some markers of inflammation and oxidative stress as well as incidence of newborn hyperbilirubinemia . In hemodialysis patients, omega-3 significantly reduced serum creatinine , but did not reduce arteriovenous fistula failure .Data on omega-3 for cancer prevention are inconclusive. It may reduce colon cancer risk ; improve immune response in patients undergoing colorectal cancer resection ; and reduce the incidence and severity of oxaliplatin-related neurotoxicity but did not affect cancer outcomes . Also, perioperative use of intravenous omega-3 resulted in infectious complications in patients undergoing elective colon resection for non-metastasized cancer . Conflicting data suggest beneficial association between higher omega-3 intake and improved survival among stage III colon cancer patients with wild-type KRAS and deficient MMR ; supplementation also reduced occurrence of renal cell carcinoma in women . Furthermore, fish oil may lower the risk of breast cancer ; improve overall survival and xerostomia, but not toxicity associated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy in patients with locally advanced breast cancer. Data from the Selenium and Vitamin E Cancer Prevention Trial (SELECT) showed high blood levels of omega-3 to be associated with increased risk of prostate cancer . In patients with sporadic colorectal neoplasia, EPA did not affect reductions in the proportion of patients with at least one colorectal adenoma when compared to aspirin or placebo . Also, in the prevention trial VITAL, supplementation did not lower incidence of invasive cancer or major cardiovascular events compared to placebo although updated analyses show significant reduction in cancer mortality .Preliminary findings suggest that fish oil increases efficacy of chemotherapy, improves survival , and helps maintain weight and muscle mass in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC); and improves quality of life scores in gastrointestinal cancer patients . But conflicting data suggest otherwise although a positive correlation was reported between adherence to supplementation and the ability to reduce weight loss during radiotherapy . Additional studies found an EPA-enriched oral supplement improved tolerability of chemotherapy in advanced colorectal cancer patients ; and when combined with chemotherapy, fish oil supplements may delay tumor progression in those with colorectal cancer . Omega-3 may also have a protective effect on the olfactory system in patients following endoscopic resection of sellar and parasellar masses .",,"Omega-3 fatty acids are polyunsaturated fatty acids containing two or more double bonds in their acyl chain and a double bond on carbon number (3) (26). Changes in omega-3 fatty acid blood levels have been associated with cardiovascular disease and depression (27). The cardioprotective effects of omega-3 fatty acids likely are due its ability to be incorporated into and thereby enhance the stability of atherosclerotic plaques (26). Increasing the intake of polyunsaturated fatty acids has been shown to increase lipid peroxidation. Supplementation with omega-3 fatty acids, therefore, may increase oxidative stress on the body. Studies have shown that mucosal alpha-tocopherol levels decrease upon omega-3 fatty acid supplementation, which researchers believe may result from the body’s attempt to counteract the added oxidative burden (11). Besides reducing serum antioxidant levels, little is known about how this added oxidative stress affects the body.Omega-3 fatty acid supplementation has been shown to decrease IL-6 (18) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (28) levels while leaving most other mononuclear cell functions unaffected (29). Omega-3 fatty acids may also reduce inflammation in patients with ulcerative colitis by reducing rectal dialysate leukotriene B4 (10). Because of their anti-inflammatory effects, omega-3 fatty acids were thought to benefit patients with asthma (22) and cystic fibrosis (21), but data are inconclusive.Increasing PUFA intake in pregnant women increases PUFA concentration but not cytokine concentration in human milk (30). Omega-3 fatty acid supplementation provides protection against ultra-violet radiation-induced erythema and p53 expression, a biomarker of DNA damage (20).","Cod liver oil fish-liver |

DSI000057,Turmeric,C0041356,"Prevalent in South Asia, turmeric is now cultivated in tropical areas around the world. Its rhizome is used as a spice in regional cuisines, and as a coloring agent in food and cosmetics. It is also used in traditional medicine systems for improving circulation and digestion. Turmeric extracts are marketed as dietary supplements to improve memory, for arthritis, and for cancer prevention. The active constituents are turmerone oil and water-soluble curcuminoids, among which curcumin has been the focus of research the past few years. Preclinical studies showed that it has weak phytoestrogenic activity, although at a concentration not achievable by oral ingestion , and exhibits neuroprotective , choleretic , anti-inflammatory , immunomodulatory , anti-proliferative , as well as chemopreventive properties . Curcumin, its analogs, and liposomal formulations also demonstrated chemosensitizing and radiosensitizing effects . Clinical findings suggest benefits of turmeric for major depressive disorder , and epidemiological data indicate improved cognitive performance in elderly Asians who consumed turmeric . But there were no benefits of curcumin supplements in patients with Alzheimer’s disease . Turmeric may also help alleviate symptoms associated with gastrointestinal issues , irritable bowel syndrome and quiescent ulcerative colitis , as well as reduce arterial stiffness in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and benefit children and adolescents with asthma . It was also found safe and as effective as paracetamol or an NSAID for treating osteoarthritis of the knee, but did not affect knee effusion-synovitis or cartilage composition . Topical use of turmeric reduced the size of lesions in patients with vitiligo . Curcumin was also reported beneficial for osteoarthritis of knee and sarcopenia in older subjects . In postmenopausal women, curcumin combined with aerobic exercise training improved vascular endothelial function . But findings of its effects on serum cholesterol levels are mixed . A systematic review found that both turmeric and curcumin may benefit patients with non alcoholic fatty liver disease . When combined with antipsychotics, curcumin may also help control symptoms of chronic schizophrenia and was associated with significant reductions in serum CRP and IL-6 levels in hemodialysis patients . In cancer settings, preliminary findings suggest benefits of turmeric supplements in improving quality of life and hematological parameters in breast cancer patients and in decreasing rates of hand-foot syndrome following capecitabine treatment . In studies using curcumin, a phase II trial of patients with advanced pancreatic cancer reported clinically relevant biological activity in two patients despite limited absorption ; a blend of green tea, pomegranate, broccoli and curcumin led to a reduction in the rate of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) increase among men with prostate cancer following a PSA relapse post-radical treatment ; when given to colorectal cancer patients during the pre-surgery waiting period, curcumin improved cachexia and anorexia-cachexia syndrome in patients with advanced head and neck cancer but did not produce similar effects in patients with solid tumors ; and when combined with hydroxytyrosol and omega-3 fatty acids, curcumin may help reduce inflammation and pain in early breast cancer patients with aromatase-induced musculoskeletal symptoms . But in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis, there was no reduction in lower intestinal tract adenomas with long-term use . Additionally, a curcumin mouthwash delayed the onset of radiation-induced oral mucositis and curcumin lozenges affected improvements in patients with oral submucous fibrosis . Topical application of either curcumin or turmeric helped control oral mucositis and radiotherapy-induced dermatitis . Furthermore, curcumin may serve as a useful adjunct to cancer treatments: When combined with docetaxel and gemcitabine , it was found to be safe in early phase studies, but high doses were needed to achieve systemic effect . In patients with metastatic colorectal cancer, curcumin was reported as a safe and tolerable adjunct to FOLFOX chemotherapy . However, curcumin is known to interfere with cytochrome P450 enzymes and may interact with chemotherapy drugs like cyclophosphamide and doxorubicin . Overall, the development of turmeric for clinical use needs further investigation due to its inherent poor absorption, rapid metabolism, complex mechanistic profile, and largely preclinical data.",,"The hepatoprotective effects of curcumin, the most researched active constituent in turmeric, may occur via MMP-13 induction and TGF-alpha inhibition (30), as well as anti-apoptotic/anti-necrotic mechanisms (31). However, it has also been shown to inhibit cell-cycle progression during normal liver regeneration (3).
A  meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials revealed that curcumin is effective in decreasing the concentration of tumor necrosis factor-alpha, a key mediator in many inflammatory diseases (68).  In vitro and animal studies of lung models point to antiproliferative and modulatory mechanisms involving inhibition of the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 Stat3 pathway (32), matrix metalloproteinase, and vascular endothelial growth factor (33); caspase- and mitochondria-dependent apoptosis (34) (35); and cyclin-dependent kinase downregulation (35). Curcumin also appears to have synergistic effects with isoflavones, suppressing the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) production in prostate cells through anti-androgen effects (36).
Studies done on breast cancer show that curcumin may inhibit chemotherapy-induced apoptosis via inhibition of the c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway and generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) (28). Data also suggest that curcumin induces apoptosis in human colon cancer cells independent of p21 expression (39). Curcumin’s antitumor actions appear to be due to its interactions with arachidonate metabolism and its in vivo antiangiogenic properties (14). Another possible chemopreventive mechanism may be via binding and activating the vitamin D receptor (VDR), thereby protecting the small intestine and colon where VDRs are expressed and vitamin D is known to serve an anticancer function (38). Curcumin also inhibited growth of uterine leiomyosarcoma cells by targeting the AKT-mTOR (RAC-alpha serine-threonine-protein kinase; mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) pathway (37). Curcumin may inhibit bladder cancer progression by downregulating the expression of beta-catenin, high levels of which are associated with several cancers (69).
Another study found that CRM1, an important nuclear exportin, is a cellular target of curcumin; and that the inhibition of nuclear traffic by curcumin may be responsible for its many biological effects (63).","Turmeric is a major ingredient in curry powder, a spice mix commonly used in South Asian cuisine.",Indian saffron | Curcumin | Jiang huang,Turmeric,Javanese Turmeric | Tree Turmeric | Turmeric,Turmeric,

It is marketed as a dietary supplement for diabetes, weight loss, and to improve muscle mass. Trivalent chromium from yeast extract is sometimes referred to as glucose tolerance factor in over-the-counter products. Although most people consume adequate amounts through diet, chromium deficiency has been implicated in the development of diabetes . In vitro studies suggest that chromium produces beneficial modulatory effects under hyperglycemic conditions . Animal models also suggest antidiabetic , antidepressant , and anxiolytic properties. In human studies, chromium supplementation with biotin may help improve glycemic control in type 2 diabetes , but results from other studies on chromium alone are mixed . Other data suggest chromium picolinate may increase satiety . However, many clinical studies failed to demonstrate improvements in glucose metabolism, weight loss, or muscle mass . More recently one meta-analysis suggested that overall, chromium monosupplementation improved glycemic control and lipid profiles , while another determined that chromium picolinate did not affect A1C or fasting plasma glucose . It has been posited that mixed and modest effect sizes may reflect a greater glucoregulatory effect in complex patients with comorbid diabetes, depression, and binge eating . A large population study suggests that those who consumed chromium-containing supplements have a reduced risk of diabetes, but more study is needed . In women with polycystic ovary syndrome, chromium supplementation did not affect endocrine profiles, and nitric oxide or glutathione levels, but did reduce acne, hirsutism, C-reactive protein, total antioxidant capacity, and malondialdehyde levels . However, meta-analyses suggest that for PCOS patients, chromium supplementation may not have significant benefits or the magnitude of effect is small, with clinical relevance uncertain . Chromium is poorly absorbed following oral administration, but salt forms such as chromium picolinate, niacin-bound chromium, and chromium chloride, appear to have better bioavailability. Other novel chromium compounds also have improved bioavailability . Adverse effects are rare but can include renal failure , rhabdomyolysis , liver damage , and dermatitis .",,"Chromium is an essential trace element involved with glucose and lipid metabolism, circulating insulin levels, and the peripheral activity of insulin (1). In vitro and in vivo studies suggest that chromium potentiates the activity of insulin (23) (42). This is thought to occur via enhanced intracellular tyrosine kinase activity that results from an interaction between chromium, low molecular weight chromium-binding substance, and activated cell surface insulin receptors (2).
In animal models of diabetes, chromium recovered beta cell functioning and alleviated macroangiopathy (27). It also augmented the insulin signaling pathway, dulled negative-regulators of insulin signaling, enhanced AMPK activity to increase cellular glucose uptake, and attenuated oxidative stress (42). Chromium may also modulate PPAR-gamma, insulin receptor substrate, and NF-κB proteins (28). Antidepressant effects occur via modified brain 5-HT function and increased serotonergic and noradrenergic functioning (30) (31). Additional mechanisms for antidepressant and anxiolytic effects include lower plasma corticosterone levels via reversal of HPA axis overactivity (32). In humans, suggested antidepressant mechanisms include 5HT2A downregulation and increased insulin sensitivity (38).","Chromium (III) citrate | Chromium (III) oxide | Chromium (III) sulfate | Chromium (III) potassium sulfate | Liver, American cheese, broccoli, brewer’s yeast, wheat germ, meat, eggs, chicken, fish, fruits, whole grains, brown sugar, alfalfa, and animal fats (1) (25)",Chromium III | Chromium picolinate | Niacin-bound chromium | Chromium chloride,Chromium | Chromium oxydatum | Chromium sulphuricum | Chromium kali sulphuricum,Chromium | Chromium carnosinate | Chromium Yeast | Chromium acetate | Chromium glutathionate | Chromium nitrate | Chromium Polynicotinate | Yeast (Chromium),Chromium,

The plant’s physiological actions are attributed to the caffeine found in its seeds . Guarana is promoted as an appetite suppressant, stimulant, as an aphrodisiac, and to alleviate fatigue. In vitro studies indicate that guarana has chemopreventive , neuroprotective, and anxiolytic properties. Epidemiologic data suggest protective effects against metabolic disorders in elderly populations , and guarana supplementation led to improvements in cognitive performance and mental fatigue in healthy adults . Small studies in cancer patients suggest guarana may help reduce chemotherapy-related fatigue, stabilize weight, and increase appetite . However, it did not reduce fatigue post-radiation or in patients with head and neck cancers, and some symptoms worsened compared with a placebo . A meta-analysis also concluded that guarana was not superior to placebo for cancer-related fatigue and that evidence was of low quality . Further research is needed.",,"Many of guarana’s effects are thought to be due to its high caffeine content. Caffeine’s effects include skeletal muscle, CNS, and cardiac stimulation, diuresis, increased blood pressure, inhibition of platelet aggregation, and hyperglycemia (2) (3). Guarana demonstrated antioxidant effects by inhibiting lipid peroxidation (19).

DSI000066,L-Arginine,C0003765,"Arginine is an amino acid that is synthesized in the body. Oral arginine has been used for various conditions such as hypertension, angina, atherosclerosis, migraines, and erectile dysfunction. Its vasodilatory properties are thought responsible for beneficial effects. Arginine has also been used to enhance wound healing, immune function, and athletic performance. Some studies support the use of arginine in coronary artery and peripheral artery diseases , but long-term supplementation worsened PAD . In addition, oral supplementation in patients who had an acute myocardial infarction did not improve ejection fraction or vascular stiffness, and may be associated with higher mortality . A meta-analysis of arginine supplementation on markers for cardiovascular disease, obesity, or diabetes also did not find benefit, except perhaps in a select group of patients . Smaller studies suggest supplementation with arginine, glutamine, and HMB may benefit vascular endothelial function in older adults , but arginine supplementation alone did not improve blood flow or muscle performance in older women . In cancer patients, preliminary data are mixed for perioperative enteral arginine-enriched formulas to improve wound healing and immune function , but other studies suggest such formulas may reduce complications and length of hospital stay . However, early postoperative arginine-enriched feeding had no impact on long-term survival in patients undergoing surgery for oesophagogastric and pancreaticobiliary cancers , and a trial of an oral formula containing arginine, HMB, and glutamine to improve cachexia management in newly diagnosed lung cancer patients was halted due to slow accrual and partial adherence . Some data suggest a prophylactic arginine-containing supplement may reduce incidence of hand-foot syndrome in hepatocellular carcinoma patients taking sorafenib . Interestingly, arginine deprivation-based treatments are also being pursued as potential cancer treatments . Although a meta-analysis did not find significant effects with arginine supplementation on inflammatory biomarkers, subgroup analysis suggests it may increase circulating C-reactive protein in cancer patients, those older than age 60 or with higher baseline CRP levels, or with use of enteral formulas . Additional studies are needed to determine the circumstances under which arginine supplementation could be safe and effective.",,"Arginine is unique among amino acids for its vasodilatory properties (11). Arginine acts as a precursor for the synthesis of endogenous NO via the action of nitric oxide synthase. NO functions as a paracrine-signaling molecule mediating vasodilation and inhibition of platelet activation, monocyte and leucocyte adhesion, and smooth muscle cell proliferation. NO also helps to control vascular oxidative stress and redox-regulated gene expression (22). Arginine is also needed for the synthesis of creatine which is important in muscle contraction (22). In colorectal adenoma cells, arginine reduces the expression of survivin, an inhibitor of apoptosis, and induces iNOS expression (23).","L-arginine | Arginine PCA | L-Arginine nitrate | L-arginine | Meat, poultry, fish, dairy products, nuts, seeds, soy foods, legumes, and chocolate",L-arginine,"L-Arginine | 5-Oxo-L-proline, compound with L-arginine (1:1) | Arginine PCA  | L-Arginine nitrate | (2S)-2-Amino-5-guanidinopentanoic acid (2S)-2-aminobutanedioate | Arginine | L-arginine | L-Arginine ethyl ester | Arginine silicate inositol",Arginine | Arginine Creatine | Arginine nitrate | Arginine malate | Arginine carglumate | Arginine orotate | Arginine silicate inositol | Arginine-L-malate | Arginine hydroxymethylbutyrate | Arginine silicate | L-Arginine,Arginine,
DSI000067,Tribulus terrestris,C0330899,"Tribulus is a perennial herb that grows in the subtropical regions of eastern and western Asia, southern Europe, and Africa. It is used in traditional Chinese medicine and in Ayurveda for chest pain, heart-related problems, dizziness, skin and eye disorders, to expel kidney stones, and as a diuretic and tonic. It is also marketed as a dietary supplement to enhance sexual function and for body building . Preclinical studies indicate that tribulus has analgesic , antihypertensive , anti-inflammatory , antiedematous , antioxidant , diuretic , hypoglycemic , antibacterial , antifungal , cardioprotective , and anticancer properties . Saponins in tribulus were reported to inhibit platelet aggregation, in vitro and to have antidepressive effects in a murine model . In a diabetic neuropathic pain model, a standardized tribulus extract was comparable to Pregabalin, with significant increases in pain threshold responses . Tribulus also increased sperm production , but its effects on modulating testosterone levels are mixed . In clinical studies, testosterone increases only occurred when tribulus was part of a combined supplement therapy, making it difficult to determine its contribution to this effect . Data on its benefits against erectile dysfunction are mixed . A pilot study evaluating tribulus in men with partial androgen deficiency showed significant differences in testosterone levels and erectile function, but no significant differences in levels of luteinizing hormone . In women, however, small studies indicate improvements in sexual dysfunction and improvements in hypoactive sexual desire disorder in pre- and postmenopausal subjects . In addition, formulations containing tribulus were found useful against bacterial vaginitis and for lowering blood pressure in prehypertensive individuals . A tribulus extract used alone did not not improve androgenic status or physical performance among athletes but may attenuate exercise-induced oxidative stress, muscle damage, and inflammation . Saponins in tribulus have shown activity against breast and prostate cancer cells , and may protect against UVB-induced carcinogenesis . In animal models, tribulus affected a significant reduction in tumor incidence, tumor burden, and cumulative number of papillomas , and relieved cisplatin-induced renal toxicity . Due to its purported hormonal activities, prostate cancer patients should consult with their physicians before using tribulus.",,"In vitro, cinnamic amides in tribulus fruits inhibit papain-like protease (PLpro), an essential proteolytic enzyme which plays a critical role in virus-mediated RNA replication (42). Di-p-coumaroylquinic acid derivatives in tribulus are associated with its antioxidant effects (43).
Aphrodisiac effects may be associated with the constituent protodioscin, which leads to an increase in some sex hormones (44). Erectogenic effects may also occur via conversion of protodioscin to DHEA (36) or by concentration-dependent relaxation of the corpus cavernosum (CC) via reactions in the nitric oxide (NO)/NO synthase pathway and CC endothelium (45) (25). The NO release effect may explain observed physiological responses to tribulus supplementation, independent of testosterone level (25). In a study conducted in rats with ovarian cysts, tribulus extract showed a luteinizing effect related to gonadotropin-like activity (20).
Saponins exhibit cytotoxic and antihyperlipidemic effects (42). They may protect against atherosclerosis by suppressing angiotensin II-induced vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation via inhibition of intracellular ROS production, calcium ion mobilization, pkc-α expression, ERK1/2 phosphorylation, and proto-oncogene expression (46). In ischemic cells, polyphenol-mediated antioxidant activity with tribulus extract resulted in significant suppression of LDH release, ROS generation, and superoxide production (29).
In animal models, tribulus exerts a protective effect in diabetic rats by inhibiting oxidative stress (6) and lowering levels of glycosylated hemoglobin and cholesterols (8). In diabetic neuropathic pain models, tribulus modulates oxidative stress and inflammatory cytokine release in a dose-dependent manner via increases in superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, and reduced glutathione and lipid peroxide levels (32). In chronic mild stress models, the attenuation of serum corticotropin-releasing factor and cortisol levels by tribulus saponins suggest normalization of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis hyperactivity (31). Antihypertensive effects occur via arterial smooth muscle relaxation, NO release, and membrane hyperpolarization (3). An aqueous extract also demonstrated angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibition activity (2) that may help lower blood pressure. Phenolic acids such as chlorogenic acid, caffeic acid and 4-hydroxybenzoic acid may be responsible for reputed cardioprotective properties (29).
Tribulus extracts induce apoptosis and suppress cancer cell proliferation by activating caspase 3, dephosphorylating extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK) 1 and 2 (15), and by inhibiting nuclear factor (NF-kappa B) signaling (12). Saponins from tribulus inhibit multiple-drug resistance of cancer cells (11). In breast carcinoma cell lines, a saponin extract changed mRNA levels of CXCR4, CCR7 and BCL2 genes (38). In models of human prostate cancer, antitumor and antiangiogenic activities are attributed to cell-cycle arrest and apoptotic induction not involving the caspase pathway (39). Saponins also act as a modulator of apoptosis: in normal human keratinocytes, saponins attenuate UVB-induced programmed cell death through inhibition of intrinsic apoptotic pathway, but enhance apoptotic response in squamous cell carcinomas (40). The photoprotective effect of saponins is attributed to enhanced NER gene expression and inhibition of UVB-mediated NF-kappaB activation (40). In animal models, a hydroalcoholic extract of tribulus relieved cisplatin-induced renal toxicity, perhaps via diuretic effects that increase drug excretion, scavenging free radicals via increase in antioxidant enzymes, suppressing inflammatory agents, and acting on organic cation transporter 2 (OCT2) proteins (41).
Tribulus extract was shown to limit formation of calcium oxalate and calcium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate crystals (21) (22), mineral compounds that can cause kidney stones.
Consumption of tribulus causes motor neuron adverse effects in animals by affecting the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors (18). The steroidal saponin diosgenin is thought to be responsible for hepatotoxic effects associated with tribulus (27).",Tribulus terrestris - Fruit,Caltrop | Puncture vine | Gokhru | Al-Gutub | Ba ji li,Tribulus terrestris | Tribulus terrestris - Fruit ,,Tribulus terrestris,
DSI000068,Trigonella foenum-graecum,C0060207,"Fenugreek is derived from the dried seeds of the plant, with a scent and taste similar to maple syrup. It is used in ayurvedic medicine as a demulcent, laxative, and to increase breast milk supply. It is also used as a dietary supplement to treat various conditions including diabetes, high cholesterol, wounds, inflammation, and gastrointestinal complaints.Preclinical studies suggest fenugreek has hypocholesterolemic , hypolipidemic , hypoglycemic , antimicrobial , hepatoprotective , and antinociceptive effects.Data in humans are limited. Small studies showed benefits of fenugreek for mild asthma , metabolic syndrome , as well as menopausal , postmenopausal , polycystic ovary syndrome symptoms , and Alzheimer’s disease . Data also suggest it may improve exercise performance , lipid parameters and glycemic control , and decrease insulin resistance in type-2 diabetic patients . More research is needed to confirm these effects .Fenugreek demonstrated chemopreventive and chemoprotective properties , but human studies have not been conducted. Fenugreek also acts as an estrogen receptor modulator and stimulates breast cancer cells in vitro , but evidence of its potential to stimulate lactation is limited .",,"The hypoglycemic activity of fenugreek may be associated with the galactomannan fiber and saponin components that reduce gastrointestinal glucose and cholesterol absorption, and increase bile acid excretion (14). 4-Hydroxyisoleucine, an amino acid constituent, potentiates insulin secretion in non-insulin-dependent diabetic rats when administered intraperitoneally (15). In addition to lower fasting and postprandial glucose levels, fenugreek-treated diabetic rats had higher hemoglobin, GSH, and plasma antioxidant levels and lower glycosylated hemoglobin, plasma lipids, and TBARS levels than diabetic controls (4). Dietary fenugreek also normalizes the activities of glucose and lipid-metabolizing enzymes in diabetic rats (3). Other animal studies suggest dietary fenugreek increases serum T4, liver GSH, glyoxalase I, and GST activities, and decreases T3 levels and T3/T4 ratio (17) (18) (19). In humans, fenugreek intake was associated with an increase in molar insulin binding sites of erythrocytes, which may enhance glucose utilization (16).Fenugreek has also been studied for its anticancer potential. In MCF-7 estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer cells, a fenugreek extract induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis (9). Dioscin, a steroidal saponin isolated from fenugreek, suppressed cell viability of ovarian cancer cells by regulating VEGFR2, PI3K, phosphorylated AKT and phosphorylated p38 MAPK signaling pathways (39).In a case report of serotonin syndrome likely caused by an interaction between fenugreek and sertraline, the authors point to animal studies that posit 4-hydroxyisoleucine may increase serotonin turnover in the brain (47).",Trigonella foenum-graecum - seed,Bird's foot | Greek hayseed | Bockshornsame | Methi | Hu lu ba,Trigonella foenum-graecum | Fenugreek,Fenugreek fiber | Fenugreek Fiber | Fenugreek,Fenugreek,

DSI000071,Calcium,C2936886,"Calcium is an essential mineral responsible for many physiological functions. It helps maintain bone structure and plays an important role in cell signaling and muscle contraction. Dietary sources of calcium include dairy products, dark greens, legumes, nuts and fish. Natural supplements are derived from minerals, oyster shells and occasionally corals.Calcium has been studied for a range of conditions including cardiovascular disease , osteoporosis , bone density loss , fracture prevention , premenstrual syndrome , pre-eclampsia , lead poisoning , and various cancers .Long-term supplement use was associated with an increased risk of coronary artery calcification and may lead to cardiovascular disease (CVD) , although findings remain debatable . In a Women’s Health Initiative sub-study, calcium plus vitamin D supplementation and hormone therapy yielded greater reductions in LDL-C than either intervention alone or placebo but supplementation did not always modify the effects of hormonal therapy on CVD events . Calcium and vitamin D supplementation may also benefit postmenopausal women who do not have pre-existing risk factors such as coronary heart disease, diabetes, or hypertension ; and large long-term studies in women did not find adverse cardiovascular associations with calcium supplementation , but a meta analysis reported an increase in the risk of CVD . High intake of supplements also increased cardiovascular mortality in men . Another study found supplementation to be associated with dementia in women following stroke , but dietary intake of vitamin D and calcium were reported useful in maintaining cognitive performance in older females .There is also conflicting evidence surrounding the benefits of calcium or calcium plus vitamin D supplements for bone health . The US Preventive Services Task Force did not find any associations between calcium plus vitamin D supplementation and reduced falls or fracture incidence in community-dwelling older adults without known deficiencies, osteoporosis, or history of fracture . In postmenopausal women, neither dietary calcium nor calcium plus vitamin D supplements reduced risk of hip fracture, although the latter study found significant reductions at 7 years . Subgroup analysis further suggested that supplementation along with estrogen therapy conferred additive protection against hip fractures . However, there appear to be no preventive benefits with supplementation for bone mineral density loss in breast cancer patients , in older adults , or in healthy men . But in a study of pediatric cancer survivors, hypocalcemia induced by standard osteoporotic medication was treated with continuous calcium supplementation . Calcium plus vitamin D also reduced bone density loss associated with antiretroviral therapy in HIV patients .In cancer settings, both dietary and supplemental calcium were linked with lower risk of colorectal cancer , with dietary calcium more beneficial in reducing the risk of incidence and recurrence of colorectal and advanced adenomas . Calcium intake was associated with increased risk for prostate cancer ; notably a genetic disposition for high intestinal absorption of calcium was reported in African-American men . Long-term studies suggest risks associated with calcium in prostate cancers are less strong when phosphorus intake is also considered . Data also suggest benefits against cutaneous metastases .In women, studies on calcium plus vitamin D supplements for reduced risk reported positive association with ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) but conflicting data for colorectal cancers , all cancer types , and mortality . Other trials suggest benefits against hematologic but not invasive cancers . Available evidence is insufficient to assess benefits of calcium plus vitamin D supplementation for those receiving androgen deprivation therapy, aromatase inhibitors, or undergoing chemotherapy-induced menopause . Patients should consult with their oncologists or oncology healthcare teams, especially since calcium supplements can interact with a number of prescription medications.A balanced diet containing sodium, potassium, magnesium, calcium and vitamin D is important to reduce risks for hypertension as well as cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events . But the risk-benefit ratio of supplementation is likely to vary, depending on dietary calcium intake, sex, age, ethnicity, and individual risks for cardiovascular disease and osteoporosis . In adults with normal calcium levels, genetic predisposition to higher serum levels does not affect bone mineral density nor protect against fractures . Intake of high-dose calcium supplements (>1 g/day) may actually increase the risk of ischemic stroke , and calcium plus vitamin D supplementation may elevate the risk for kidney stones .",,"Calcium plays an important role in a variety of muscular, vascular, neurological, hormonal, and enzymatic reactions. Calcium reserves are found mostly in the bones, helping to maintain skeletal structure.The association of supplemental but not dietary calcium with increased cardiovascular risk could be related to their differing, acute effects on serum calcium (45). Supplementation may fail to compensate for renal calcium loss, resulting in increased circulatory calcium that could lead to coronary artery deposits (46). Reduced dietary intake may cause calcium depletion in membrane storage sites decreasing stability of vascular smooth muscle cell membranes, as optimal concentrations stabilize these membranes, inhibit calcium entry into cells, and reduce vasoconstriction (47). Gastrointestinal events associated with calcium supplements may also account for an increase in self-reported cardiovascular events (18).Observed associations of dairy with overall prostate cancer risk may be related to the modulation of vitamin D metabolism by calcium and phosphorus (15) (31). Saturated fat in whole dairy correlating with higher C-peptide concentrations, along with obesity and hyper-insulinemia, are proposed for associating whole milk with fatal prostate cancer (31). Other suggested mechanisms include increasing levels of ionized calcium in the blood, as prostate cancer cells express both calcium-sensing receptors and calcium-dependent voltage-gated channels, the stimulation of which by extracellular calcium increases prostate cancer cell growth (44) (35). In African American men, positive associations between calcium and aggressive prostate cancer have been linked to single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the CDX-2 binding site of the VDR gene (32).","Calcium carbonate | Bos taurus - Milk | Calcium iodide tetrahydrate | Calcium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate | Calcium caprylate | Calcium chloride | Calcium sulfate | Oyster shell | Calcium fluoride | Calcium hydroxyapatite | Calcium iodide | Milk, yogurt, cheese, egg, bread, salmon, prawns, sardines, shrimp, broccoli, spinach, kale, collards, spring greens, baked beans, chickpeas, lentils, kidney beans, soya beans, tofu, orange, almonds, sesame seeds and fortified cereals, orange juice and soy milk",Calcium carbonate | Calcium citrate | Calcium gluconate,Calcium | Calcium Caseinate | Calcium iodatum | Calcium phosphoricum | Calcium di(octanoate) | Calcium chloride(CaCl2) | Calcium sodium phosphosilicate | Calcium sulfuricum | Calcium carbonicum Hahnemanni | Calcium Bisglycinate | Calcium fluoratum | Calcium hydroxyapatite | Calcium 2-oxopropanoate | Calcium jodatum | Calcium hypochlorite,Calcium d-Glucarate | Calcium fructopyranose borate | Calcium Formate | Calcium | Calcium hydroxymethylbutyrate | Calcium borate | Calcium Fructoborate | Calcium hydroxyisopcaproate | Calcium phytate | Calcium 2-aminoethylphosphate | Calcium fructate,Calcium,

DSI000074,Panax ginseng,C0086767,"A popular herb often confused with Asian or Panax ginseng, American ginseng has unique medicinal properties. It is frequently used in Chinese medicine to nourish “Yin” . American ginseng is also used in supplemental form to improve athletic performance, strength, and stamina, and to treat diabetes and cancer. Saponin glycosides, also known as ginsenosides or panaxosides, are thought responsible for its biological effects. In lab studies, ginsenosides have both stimulatory and inhibitory CNS effects , can alter cardiovascular tone, enhance humoral and cellular-dependent immunity, and exert anticancer effects . Other preclinical studies suggest enhanced anticancer activities when combined with antioxidants , synergistic effects with 5-fluorouracil , and protection against oxidative stress in irradiated human lymphocytes . Studies in humans are limited. Current data suggest that American ginseng may help improve glucose control in diabetics and that it is safe for long-term use . It has a modest effect in reducing number and severity of colds , and may enhance working memory . Findings from clinical trials on whether American ginseng can improve cancer-related fatigue are mixed , although a large multisite trial suggests benefit , and a systematic review/meta analysis reported efficacy of ginseng-containing formulas in reducing fatigue, but not ginseng alone . Epidemiological data suggest it may improve survival and quality of life in breast cancer patients , but more studies are needed. | Panax ginseng is an herb native to East Asia and Russia. It is also cultivated for its medicinal properties and the root is widely used as a “Yang” tonic in traditional medicine . Patients take ginseng to improve athletic performance, strength, and stamina, and as an immunostimulant. Some use it to treat diabetes, cancer, HIV/AIDS, and a variety of other conditions. Ginsenosides, the saponin glycosides, are thought responsible for medicinal effects of P. ginseng. They have both stimulatory and inhibitory effects on the CNS, alter cardiovascular tone, and increase humoral and cellular-dependent immunity . Studies in humans are limited. Although ginseng has been used in the treatment of erectile dysfunction , the effect may be trivial and the quality of evidence for most studies is low . Other preliminary data suggest it can be helpful for type II diabetic patients , but more studies are needed. Small studies suggest ginseng may enhance immune functioning in various populations or benefit patients with prehypertension or hypertension . It may also improve menopausal symptoms and markers for cardiovascular disease . Other data suggest ginseng helps alleviate idiopathic chronic fatigue and cold hypersensitivity of hands and feet in women . Ginseng has also been investigated for potential anticancer properties. Ginsenosides exhibit antiproliferative effects in vitro . Epidemiological data in breast cancer patients show improved survival and quality of life with ginseng use , and reduced risk of endometrial cancer in breast cancer survivors . In addition, two case-controlled studies indicate a positive association between consumption and reduction in the incidence of all cancers . In small randomized studies, ginseng reduced genotoxicity and improved quality of life in patients with epithelial ovarian cancer but did not relieve surgical menopause symptoms in those with gynecologic cancers . Also, ginseng did not alleviate fatigue in advanced cancer patients although a systematic review/meta analysis reported efficacy of ginseng-containing formulas in reducing fatigue, but not ginseng alone . Because ginseng was shown to have estrogenic effects , patients with hormone-sensitive cancers should consult their physicians before using it. Panax ginseng should not be confused with American ginseng (Panax quinquefolius) or Siberian ginseng (Eleutherococcus senticosus), which have different medicinal properties. It should also not be confused with Panax notoginseng which also has different properties , and is a key ingredient in the TCM formula Yunnan baiyao.",,"Ginsenosides are thought responsible for American ginseng’s activity, although the exact mechanism of action is unknown. Related species, such as Panax ginseng, have been the focus of most laboratory and clinical research. Experiments using extracts from these species indicate that ginsenosides stimulate and inhibit the central nervous system (4). The extracts also stimulate TNF alpha production by alveolar macrophages (10).
The Rg1 ginsenoside present in American ginseng is associated with improvements in humoral and cell-mediated immune response and increases in T helper cells, T lymphocytes, and NK cells in mice (5). American ginseng was also shown to lower serum glucose and may affect carbohydrate metabolism (2) (6).
Several ginsenosides have demonstrated anticancer properties in vitro (3). Current data suggest that antiproliferative effects of American ginseng are due to compound K, a metabolite of the ginsenoside Rb1, but not Rb1 as previously thought (22). In a rodent study, the herb significantly attenuated colon carcinogenesis by reducing tumor number and load, and was associated with suppression of proinflammatory cytokine activation (26). | Animal studies suggest ginsenosides prolong drug-induced sleeping time in mice and exhibit additional depressant effects on the CNS (2). In addition, the ginsenoside Rb1 improves acetylcholine release and enhances postsynaptic uptake of choline (2). In other animal studies, ginseng saponins lowered total plasma cholesterol and triglyceride levels (15). Ginseng may improve NO synthesis in endothelium of the heart, lung, kidneys, and in the corpus cavernosum (13).
In humans, oral intake of ginseng reduced post-exercise muscle injury and inflammation marked by reduced creatine kinase, beta-glucuronidase, and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (14).
Anticancer activity has been observed in vitro with several ginsenosides. Differentiation of HL-60 promyelocytic cells was induced in ginsenosides Rh2- and Rh3-treated cells (2). Rg3 exerted effects in part by blocking the nuclear translocation of the protein ß-catenin in colon cancer cells, most of which turned cancerous via activation of the Wnt/ß-catenin signaling pathway (25). Rp1 reduced breast cancer cell proliferation by decreasing stability of the insulin like growth factor 1 receptor protein in breast cancer cells (26).",Panax ginseng - root | Panax ginseng - root | Root | Root | Root,Xi yang shen | Western ginseng | Five-fingers | Chinese ginseng | Ren shen | Korean ginseng | Red ginseng,Panax ginseng | Panax ginseng C.A.

It is used in traditional medicine as a diuretic, laxative, stimulant, aphrodisiac and for treating diabetes and venereal diseases. Damiana showed anxiolytic , antidepressant , hypoglycemic , anti-ulcer as well as cytotoxic effects; and stimulated sexual behavior in preclinical models. Whether it has estrogenic effects is not clear as findings are mixed . Small studies suggest formulations containing damiana may induce weight loss and produce short-term effects on caloric intake in overweight adults, improve menopausal symptoms , and sexual function in post-menopausal women . Confirmatory research is needed. Of note, damiana is used in the botanical formulation ArginMax , which is marketed as a treatment for female sexual dysfunction.",,"Damiana’s anti-ulcer activity is believed to be due to the inhibition of lipid peroxidation, immuno modulation and antioxidant effects of its major constituent, arbutin (15).

Other compounds including apigenin 7-glucoside, Z-echinacin and pinocembrin demonstrated estrogenic activity (12).The pro-sexual activity of damiana was shown to involve the nitric oxide pathway, with the anxiolytic property of the herb thought to contribute to such effects (14).",Leafy twigs | Leaves | Leaf,"

DSI000076,Urtica dioica,C0600609,"Nettle is a perennial herbaceous flowering plant native to Asia, Europe, and North America. The root is widely used to treat benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH), allergies, arthritis, and inflammation. Nettle is usually combined with herbs such as saw palmetto and pygeum for the treatment of BPH. Several compounds have been isolated from nettle including flavonoid glycosides that appear to contribute to its biological effects, although the precise mechanism of action is unclear. In vitro and animal studies indicate that nettle extract has reno- and hepatoprotective properties, and is effective against colitis in mice . Other preclinical data suggest nettle has antiproliferative effects in prostate cancer cells , may protect against cisplatin-induced toxicity , enhance cancer cell sensitivity to paclitaxel or increase cisplatin cytotoxicity . Studies in humans are limited, but suggest benefits with nettle in osteoarthritis of the hip, knee , and hand , gonarthritis , and for symptoms associated with benign prostatic syndrome . A combination of saw palmetto and nettle improved nocturnal voiding frequency compared to placebo, and was similar to tamsulosin or finasteride for moderate to severe lower urinary tract symptoms/BPH . In another study, nettle improved glycemic control in type-2 diabetic patients .",,"In vitro studies show that nettle extract inhibits several inflammatory events responsible for seasonal allergies (2). These include antagonist and negative agonist activity against the histamine-1 receptor, and inhibition of prostaglandin formation via inhibition of COX-1, COX-2, and hematopoietic prostaglandin D2 synthase, key enzymes in proinflammatory pathways (2).
Phenolic compounds derived from nettle inhibited alpha-glucosidase and alpha-amylase, chief enzymes involved in type-2 diabetes (24). Inhibition of these enzymes results in decreased reabsorption of glucose in the intestine.
Compounds in nettle essential oil including carvacrol may have cytotoxic and genotoxic effects (12).",Herb top,Stinging nettle | Common nettle | Greater nettle,Urtica dioica,Dwarf Nettle | Nettle (mixed) | Nettle (unspecified) | Stinging Nettle | White Dead Nettle Flower | White Nettle,Nettle,

DSI000093,Hypericum perforatum,C0813171,"St. John’s wort is a perennial herb indigenous to Europe, West Asia, and North Africa, and now prevalent in many parts of the world. The flowering tops are reputed for their medicinal properties and the herb has a centuries-long history as a remedy for headaches, kidney problems, and nerve disorders. St. John’s Wort was also used by Native Americans for wound healing, snakebites, and diarrhea. Today it is used in several European countries as an antidepressant, and to treat anxiety, sleep problems, and seasonal affective disorder. It is also marketed in the US as a dietary supplement to support emotional well-being. St. John’s wort is one of the most extensively studied herbs, with active constituents hyperforin and hypericin being the focus of most research. Lab studies show that it has neuroprotective properties and may relieve neuropathic pain . Clinical studies suggest St. John’s wort may be as effective as SSRIs such as paroxetine , fluoxetine and citalopram for mild to moderate depression. It was also shown to be a cost-effective alternative to generic antidepressants . Reductions in depression were sustained as well with continued use . However, data are inconsistent when all types of depression are analyzed and some randomized trials have found St. John’s wort ineffective for both major and minor depression . A few studies suggest efficacy with St. John’s wort for premenstrual syndrome and vasomotor symptoms in peri- and postmenopausal women . It may also enhance the effect of clopidogrel in patients who have undergone percutaneous coronary intervention , but more studies are needed. Its use did not improve symptoms in children and adolescents with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder . St. John’s wort has many documented interactions with conventional drugs resulting in reduced efficacy or treatment failure, as well as several associated adverse effects. Its use may also cause photosensitivity and has been associated with increased risk of cataracts . Therefore, patients should speak with their physician or pharmacist before using this product.",,"In vitro studies suggest hypericum inhibits serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine reuptake by neurons (22) (23). Although earlier data suggested MOA inhibition, additional findings were insignificant in vivo (24). More recently hyperforin, the main constituent associated with serotonin reuptake inhibition, activated transient receptor potential C6 channels in vitro inducing neurite outgrowth and possibly influencing monoamine uptake (25), and stimulated development and function of oligodendrocytes (26). Hypericin suppresses voltage-dependent calcium channel and mitogen-activated protein kinase activity and evokes glutamate release, adding further clues to its function in the brain (27).
Hypericin-induced phototoxicity appears to be oxygen-dependent and may involve intracellular pH reduction or mediation by TNF-related apoptosis inducing ligand receptor systems (28). Incidental reporting also suggests photoactivated hypericin can cause demyelination of cutaneous axons (29).
Mechanisms by which St. John’s wort induces or modulates different enzymes and alters pharmacokinetics of corresponding drug substrates continue to be evaluated. Hyperforin induces CYP3A4 through activation of the pregnane X receptor (30) and St. John’s wort extract modulates UGT and P-gp activity via protein kinase C (31) (32). Analgesic and CNS activity may be due to its bioflavonoid content (21) as well as through inhibition of protein kinase C isoforms and their phosphorylation (2).
The enolized beta-dicarbonyl system contained in hyperforin may play a central role in its antiangiogenic activity, but chemical and metabolic instability of hyperforin itself has led to the search for more stable derivatives (33). In animal models, hyperforin and its stabilized derivative aristoforin suppress lymphatic endothelial cell growth and lymphangiogenesis by inducing cell cycle arrest or apoptosis (34). Hyperforin also reversed P-gp and breast cancer resistance protein activity in human myeloid leukemia cell lines (35). It exerts neuroprotective effects in PC12 cells via AKT/GSK-3β signal regulation to decrease aluminum-induced Aβ production and tau phosphorylation (82).",Hypericum perforatum - herb top,Saint John's wort | Hypericum | Goatweed | God's wonder plant | Witches herb,Hypericum perforatum,St. John's Wort,St. John's Wort,

DSI000117,Artemisia annua,C0686899,"Commonly known as wormwood or sweet sagewort, Artemisia annua has been used in traditional Chinese medicine for fevers, inflammation, headaches, bleeding, and malaria. In vitro studies indicate that artemisinin, the active principle of A. annua, may be effective for protozoal infections including leishmaniasis , Chagas’ disease, and African sleeping sickness . Cytotoxic effects of A. annua compounds have also been evaluated in tumor cell lines .Artemisinin-based combination therapies are part of the standard treatment arsenal for malaria. Systematic reviews suggest it is as effective as quinine , but increased risk of relapse may limit its uses . It is also unclear whether it is effective against quinine-resistant malaria strains. Other reports of artemisinin-based therapy resistance are also emerging, prompting additional drug development .Studies of artemisia for other conditions are limited. In one RCT, a low-dose artemisia formulation produced clinically relevant pain reductions in patients with hip or knee osteoarthritis . A subsesquent open-label continuation study demonstrated long-term safety with improvements maintained at 6 months . Artemisia improved symptoms in patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis but did not produce any clinical benefits in patients receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy . A few safety studies in advanced cancer patients suggest oral add-on artesunate, a semisynthetic artemisinin derivative, is well tolerated, although monitoring for ototoxicity is needed . In other studies, oral or intravenous artesunate did not produce a response , although modest clinical activity was observed with intravenous administration . More studies are needed to determine the conditions under which compounds derived from artemisia may be safe and effective.",,"Artemisinin, the active constituent of A. annua, exerts antimalarial effects by free radicals formed via cleavage of the endoperoxide bond in its structure, which are responsible for eradicating the Plasmodium species (23).Artemisinin induces apoptosis and cell cycle arrest of Leishmani donovani promastigotes (8). It has antiproliferative effects on medullary thyroid carcinoma cells (2), and induces apoptosis in a lung cancer cell line by modulating p38 and calcium signaling (14). In another study, it significantly inhibited cell growth and proliferation, and caused G1 cell-cycle arrest in neuroblastoma cell lines (25). Dihydroartemisinin, a semi-synthetic derivative of artemisinin, demonstrates anti-inflammatory activity by attenuating COX-2 production via downregulation of serine/threonine kinase and MAPK pathways  (24). Recent findings suggest that dihydroartemisinin-triggered apoptosis in colorectal cells occurs through the ROS-mediated mitochondria-dependent pathway (26).",Herb top,Qing Hao | Sweet sagewort | Sweet wormwood | Annual wormwood,Artemisia annua,Sweet Annie,Artemisia annua,

Anti-inflammatory effects may be due to inhibition of T-lymphocyte adhesion, causing a decrease in T-cell ability to express CD44 and produce TNFα (6). In cardiomyoblast cells, anticardiac hypertrophy effects occurred via targeted inhibition of ryanodine receptor-mediated intracellular Ca(2+) release (18).
Inhibition of TGFβ and connective tissue growth factor, both thought to induce the fibrotic process in diabetic nephropathy, was observed in HK-2 cells after exposure to the constituent astilbin (4).

DSI000158,L-Glutamine,C0017797,"Glutamine is an amino acid that can be absorbed from food and synthesized and stored, mainly in the muscles and lungs. It is the building block of proteins and a major source of cellular fuel. Although abundant in the body, patients with cancer and AIDS-related cachexia or those recovering from catabolic states such as surgery, sepsis, and intense exercise may need to increase intake. Parenteral supplementation is used in hospitals and oral formulations are available as medical food products. Glutamine is also marketed as a dietary supplement to enhance muscle building, wound healing, and for intestinal and immune system health.Despite its popularity, evidence is lacking to support the use of glutamine supplements for increasing muscle mass and strength .In post-surgical or critically ill patients, glutamine may improve nitrogen balance, preserve intestinal integrity, maintain intracellular glutamine levels, and reduce hospital stay , but data on whether it can prevent infections are mixed and it did not reduce the time to discharge alive from hospital in patients with severe burns . In patients with irritable bowel syndrome, supplementation reduced related symptoms . Among patients with sickle cell anemia, treatment with glutamine resulted in significantly fewer pain crises .In oncology settings, studies suggest glutamine or its derivatives are useful against peripheral neuropathy , mucositis , fluorouracil-induced GI toxicity and FOLFOX-induced diarrhea . Intravenous glutamine also reduced chemotherapy-induced nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea in patients with gastric or colorectal cancer , and enteral nutrition that includes arginine, glutamine, and omega-3 fatty acids may improve short-term survival in stage IV gastric cancer patients . Preliminary data on a supplement containing HMB, L-arginine and glutamine suggest it may help prevent sorafenib-associated hand-foot skin reactions in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma . In addition, perioperative diet containing arginine, glutamine, and fish oil led to reductions in mucocutaneous fistula and length of hospital stay in clean-contaminated head and neck cancer surgery patients . Glutamine alone also reduced length of hospital stay in patients with colorectal cancer . But findings from cachexia trials are mixed .Other studies suggest glutamine may reduce radiation morbidity in breast cancer patients and treatment-induced mucositis and dysphagia in patients with oropharynx and larynx carcinoma , and delay esophagitis onset in non-small cell lung cancer patients . However, meta-analyses report lack of strong evidence with glutamine for oral mucositis , for radiation dermatitis or for radiation-associated gastrointestinal toxicity , a systematic review cited the need for well-designed trials , and conflicting data indicate no impact on postsurgical complications or infections in cancer patients , nor on acute radiation-induced esophagitis in patients with advanced thoracic malignancies . Furthermore, findings also suggest a role for glutamine in tumor cell growth and maintenance . More research is needed to resolve these ambiguities.In pediatric patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, glutamine may have benefits against oral mucositis and chemo-induced peripheral neuropathy .",,"Glutamine is essential for the maintenance of intestinal mucosal integrity and function (1). It maintains immune function by serving as the principle metabolic fuel for cells, acts as a precursor for protein synthesis, and along with cysteine and glycine, is involved in glutathione (GSH) synthesis. Intravenous glutamine preserves liver and intestinal glutathione stores in animal models of oxidant damage. Glutamine is also involved in nitrogen exchange, as it neutralizes and eliminates excess ammonia formed during protein catabolism. As a nitrogen donor, it contributes to the synthesis of other non-essential amino acids, including the purines and pyrimidines, and is therefore essential for the proliferation of most cells (29). It also plays a supportive role during biochemical stress and sepsis. Reduced oxidative stress and sickle cell-related pain with l-glutamine is attributed to increased proportions of the reduced form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotides in sickle cell erythrocytes (35).Although the mechanism underlying benefits against cachexia is unclear, it is thought that glutamine, a modulator of protein turnover, enhances net protein synthesis (11). Clinical evidence suggests that total parenteral nutrition supplemented with glutamine improves nitrogen balance, maintains the intracellular glutamine pool, enhances protein synthesis, and prevents deterioration of gut permeability in post-surgery patients (12).Glutamine prevented genotoxic and clastogenic damages caused by cisplatin in mice (30). It may also potentiate the tumoricidal effect of methotrexate (MTX) since polyglutamation of MTX impairs its efflux from tumor cells and reduces its accumulation in the gut (31). The supplemental intravenous form leads to increases of GSH in the gut, but not in tumors, in a sarcoma-bearing rat model.However, other findings show that glutamine transporters are upregulated in tumor cells and that glutamine acts as a mitochondrial substrate and promotes protein translation. This indicates tumor cell dependence for growth and maintenance (26). In addition, glutamine helps cancer cells survive acidic stress through enzymatic deamidation rather than provide nutrition (27).","L-Glutamine | L-Glutamine | Alanylglutamine | L-Alany-L-glutamine | Wheat, corn, barley, peanuts, soybeans, egg whites, and milk",L-Glutamine | GLN,"L-Glutamine | Glutamine peptides | (S)-2,5-Diamino-5-oxopentanoic acid | L-Alany-L-Glutamine | L-Alany-L-glutamine | L-Glutamine or 2 - aminoglutaramic acid | L-(+)-2-Aminoglutaramic acid | L-2-Aminoglutaramic acid | (2S)-2-amino-4-carbamoyl-butanoic acid | (2S)-2-Aminoglutaramic acid | 2-aminoglutaramic acid",Creatine glutamine | Creatyl-L-glutamine | Glycyl-L-glutamine | Glutamine | Glutamine alpha-ketogutarate | Glutamine (various) | Glutamine nitrate | Glycine-alanyl-lysine-l-glutamine | Glycyl-Glutamine-L-Valine | Glutamine precursor (unspecified) | Glyceryl-L-glutamine | L-Alanyl-Glutamine | N-acetyl glutamine,Glutamine,

DSI000161,Magnesium,C3540792,"Magnesium is an essential mineral involved in numerous biochemical processes, including adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production, cellular signal transduction, DNA, RNA and protein synthesis, and bone formation . It also helps regulate blood pressure and enzymes such as those that control intracellular calcium and potassium, and is essential for normal heart functioning . The dietary form can be found in many foods, especially dark green leafy vegetables, nuts, legumes, whole grains, fruits, and fish .In dietary supplements, over-the-counter products, and pharmaceutical preparations, magnesium is combined with another substance such as a salt or acid, and has specific therapeutic uses. The carbonate, hydroxide, and oxide forms are found in antacid and laxative products whereas citrate is used as a laxative before diagnostic procedures or surgery of the colon. The chloride, gluconate, lactate, and sulfate forms are clinically used to treat magnesium deficiency.Both dietary and supplemental forms have been studied widely for their potential role to reduce risk of chronic ailments including cancer, heart disease, and diabetes. Among colorectal cancer patients, adequate magnesium intake through diet and/or supplements along with vitamin D status was associated with lower mortality risk . Other studies have not linked dietary/supplement consumption with cancer incidence and mortality , or pancreatic cancer risk , but have associated higher intake with a lower risk for colorectal tumors and lung cancer . Additionally, both low and high plasma levels were associated with an increased incident risk of cancer in hypertensive adults .Dietary intake is also associated with reduced mortality from cardiovascular disease and sudden cardiac death (SCD), although studies may be more affirmative for serum magnesium on SCD . Other studies on magnesium intake suggest increased survival in patients with heart failure , reduced stroke risk , and benefits with supplementation on endothelial function . Some studies have shown a reduction in blood pressure following supplementation , and a meta-analysis also suggests antihypertensive effects . However, data from a large community-based cohort did not show low serum levels to be a risk factor for developing hypertension or cardiovascular disease . Other small studies suggest it may help patients with asthma or cystic fibrosis .Magnesium intake has demonstrated benefits against metabolic disorders including diabetes , and a meta-analysis also suggests supplementation may benefit those with or at risk of diabetes . In other studies, positive effects were observed on bone mass accrual in healthy adolescents and bone turnover in postmenopausal osteoporotic women , while deficiencies have been linked to osteoporosis .There is moderate evidence for use of magnesium in migraine headaches and as prophylaxis , but studies of dietary or supplemental magnesium on depression are conflicting . Although preliminary data show mixed results with oral supplementation for premenstrual syndrome , a pilot study indicates that it reduces menopausal hot flashes in breast cancer patients . Supplementation does not appear to reduce leg cramps in older adults , but a systematic review found it may help leg cramps during pregnancy . Larger studies are needed to elucidate conflicting results and clarify the roles for supplementation across various health conditions.Many adults, particularly African-Americans and the elderly , may not have adequate dietary intakes of magnesium. However, true deficiency most often occurs with critical illness including cardiac conditions and preeclampsia, as well as gastrointestinal and renal conditions, poorly-controlled diabetes, and alcoholism . In addition, certain medications including calcineurin inhibitors , high-dose antivirals , and the long-term use of proton pump inhibitors , as well as some cancer therapy regimens and surgical procedures , may also cause hypomagnesemia. If deficiency is suspected, patients should be evaluated by their treating physician to determine the extent of inadequate intake and its effective management, as well as to avoid potential drug interactions or magnesium toxicity.Hypermagnesemia is rare and results from failure to excrete magnesium or because of excessive intake. It may especially occur in patients with gastrointestinal or renal dysfunction, and have serious effects such as hypotension, bradycardia, depression of tendon reflexes, and other cardiovascular and neuromuscular manifestations .Other recent findings suggest that magnesium status and supplementation differentially affects vitamin D metabolism and may therefore affect 25(OH)D status .",,"Magnesium plays a significant role in vascular and metabolic biology as well as numerous biochemical reactions. It negatively regulates vascular calcification and osteogenic differentiation through an increase or restoration of transient receptor potential melastatin 7 (TRPM7) activity and increased expression of anticalcification proteins, in vitro (45). It also influences blood pressure levels through interactions with the renin-angiotensin system, by acting as a calcium channel blocker to reduce vascular resistance, and by modulating vascular tone and reactivity (46) (47). Further, it contributes to the homeostasis of electrolytes in cells via sodium-potassium pump activation (47) and can revert impaired intracellular ion homeostasis (25).As a cofactor of all reactions involving ATP transfer, magnesium is a major determinant of insulin and glucose metabolism, critical to carbohydrate metabolism, and regulates the activity of all enzymes involved in phosphorylation reactions (48). These vascular and metabolic mechanisms are echoed by observed relationships between deficiency and oxidative stress, proinflammatory states, endothelial dysfunction, platelet aggregation, insulin resistance, and hyperglycemia (48) (49). A possible mechanism of cardiovascular benefits may be via a reduction in arterial stiffness (76).Magnesium can also serve an immunomodulatory function by regulating NF-kB activation and cytokine production, and limiting systemic inflammation (50). It also reduces markers for systemic inflammation and endothelial dysfunction including C-reactive protein (4) (51). Its salts are poorly absorbed, and act as an osmotic laxative by retaining water in the intestine. The mechanism by which it may affect the bioavailability of concomitantly administered drugs is through the formation of insoluble chelate complexes with those drugs, substantially reducing their bioavailability (52).Experimental and epidemiological evidence for the role of magnesium in cancer is conflicting. Its part in cellular metabolism and maintaining genetic stability, regulation of cell proliferation, and protection against insulin resistance, oxidative stress, and systemic inflammation are also cancer-preventive attributes (18) (19). At the same time, hypomagnesemia as a side effect of some cancer treatments may produce an inhibitory effect on tumor growth and neo-angiogenesis, but magnesium levels are also increased in tumors both in vivo and in vitro, suggesting its multiple and possibly dichotomous roles in cancer (53) (54).","Magnesium oxide | Magnesium | Magnesium Creatine Chelate | Magnesium hydrogen phosphate trihydrate | Magnesium caprylate | Magnesium chloride hexahydrate | Magnesium carbonate | Leafy vegetables, nuts, legumes, whole grains, fruits and fish (4)",Comes in many forms including: | Magnesium glycinate | Magnesium oxide | Magnesium carbonate | Magnesium hydroxide (Milk of Magnesia) | Magnesium sulfate (Epsom salts),Magnesium | Magnesium metallicum | Magnesium creatine chelate | Magnesium phosphoricum | Magnesium octanoate | Magnesium chloratum | Magnesium glycyl glutamine | Magnesium carbonicum,Magnesium Silicate | Magnesium Creatine | Magnesium borate | Magnesium | Magnesium hydrogen sulfate | Magnesium Taurinate | Magnesium Octanoate,Magnesium,

DSI000170,Eleutherococcus senticosus,C1095891,"Siberian ginseng is derived from a perennial plant primarily found in Northern Asia. Although it is not a species of ginseng, it is thought to have comparable activities. Siberian ginseng, or eleuthero, has been used traditionally as an adaptogen, performance enhancer, and immunostimulant . Active components include eleutherosides and polysaccharides . Preclinical studies suggest neuroprotective , hypoglycemic , steroid receptor binding , and cell protective effects. Studies in humans are quite limited, however. One small study of patients with knee osteoarthritis found that an herbal mixture containing Siberian ginseng relieved pain and improved physical function . Siberian ginseng may also help improve serum lipid profiles . Additional studies are needed to assess the utility and safety of this botanical.",,"In vitro studies indicate that eleuthero contains chemicals that bind to estrogen, progestin, mineralocorticoid, and glucocorticoid receptors (10). In macrophages, a Siberian ginseng extract suppressed LPS-induced iNOS expression and thus NO production likely via inhibiting NF-kappa B activity (15) (16) or Akt and JNK signaling (16), and inhibited ROS production (17).
Eleutherosides B, E, and isofraxidin — active constituents of Siberian ginseng — showed protective effects against induced atrophy of axons and dendrites in rat cultured cortical neurons (22). Isofraxidin also inhibited cell invasion and MMP-7 expression by human hepatoma cell lines, possibly through inhibition of ERK1/2 phosphorylation (18).
In animal studies, eleuthero root bark exhibited neuroprotective effects against cerebral ischemia by inhibiting COX-2, microglia, and astrocyte expression (23). Eleutherosides restored behavioral and biochemical alterations in mice with sleep deprivation (24), and alleviated both physical and mental fatigue possibly via increased fat utilization, delayed accumulation of blood urea nitrogen, and increased lactate dehydrogenase (25). Eleutherosides also mediated hyperglycemic effects by regulating insulin signaling and glucose utilization (29). In other studies, a Siberian ginseng extract decreased cadmium concentrations and cadmium-induced mitotic and apoptotic activity (26).
Siberian ginseng extract moderately inhibited breast cancer resistance protein-mediated methotrexate transport in BCRP-expressing membrane vesicles (21).",Root | Root,Eleuthero | Russian ginseng | Devil's shrub | Touch-me-not | Wild pepper | Shigoka | Ci wu ja,Eleutherococcus senticosus | Siberian ginseng,Eleutherococcus senticosus | Siberian ginseng,Siberian Ginseng,
DSI000171,"(3R,3'R,6'R)-beta,epsilon-Carotene-3,3'-diol",C0043328,"Lutein is a natural carotenoid pigment synthesized by plants and microorganisms. Carotenoids are classified as either provitamin A (alpha-carotene, beta-carotene, and beta-cryptoxanthin, which can be converted into retinol) or nonprovitamin A (lutein, lycopene, and zeaxanthin). Lutein has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities, and supplements are marketed as protection against ocular diseases such as age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and for general eye health. Preliminary studies on lutein supplementation in various populations suggest it may reduce biomarkers for coronary vascular disease, increase serum and plasma lutein, and reduce inflammatory cytokines . In addition, lutein supplementation may improve visual field in patients with retinitis pigmentosa and retinal function in patients with early AMD . A recent meta-analysis also suggests benefit with lutein supplementation for AMD , although older studies found insufficient evidence , and data on whether it improves macular pigment optical density are mixed . Other long-term studies found no effects with supplementation on cognitive function or risk for cataract surgery or vision loss . Dietary lutein may protect against DNA damage, but this may be due to concomitant intake of other micronutrients . Epidemiologic studies also suggest an association between increased lutein consumption and decreased incidence of atherosclerosis and cataracts , although the effects of dietary lutein on macular degeneration are inconsistent . With respect to effects on cancer risk, increased lutein consumption was associated with decreased risks for some types of kidney, bladder, and breast cancers , but not lung or prostate cancers , and effects on risk of cervical or colon cancer are conflicting .",,"Lutein is one of the predominant carotenoids that accumulates in both the lens and retinal macula (24). It scavenges reactive oxygen species, preventing damage to DNA and protein molecules (19) (25). As an oxycarotenoid, its structure is less hydrophobic than beta-carotene and lycopene. This enables lutein to react with free radicals in a membrane’s aqueous phase, resulting in increased membrane integrity, which may in turn affect tissue permeability to oxygen and other molecules (19). It may also protect against ocular damage by reducing the amount of blue light that reaches photoreceptors (25).
As a nonprovitamin A carotenoid, lutein does not have any vitamin A activity, but does have antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and immune-enhancing properties. In an obese rat model, lutein independently reduced superoxide dismutase activity, and also raised glutathione peroxidase activity in lean rats when combined with ascorbic acid (26). In vitro and atherosclerotic mouse models demonstrate the ability of lutein to inhibit monocyte inflammatory responses to low-density lipoprotein in the artery wall and reduce monocyte migration (7). In humans, lutein supplementation decreases lipid peroxidation and inflammatory response (5).
Carotenoids including lutein inhibit mutagenesis and transformation, and premalignant lesions (1). In murine mammary cancer models, dietary lutein selectively modulated apoptosis and inhibited angiogenesis by increasing p53 and Bax proapoptotic gene expression, while decreasing Bcl-2 antiapoptotic gene expression with a subsequent increase in Bax:Bcl-2 ratio in tumors (27). Lutein-mediated AP-1 suppression and anti-inflammatory effects are due to its antioxidative and p38/c-Jun-N-terminal kinase inhibitory activities (3). In a hepatocellular carcinoma animal model, lutein reduced γ-glutamyl transpeptidase activity, a marker of cellular proliferation (2).","Tagetes erecta - Flower | Marigold flower | Kale, spinach, winter squash, cruciferous vegetables, cabbage, green beans, yellow/orange fruits, mangoes, papayas, peaches, oranges (1).

DSI000172,Beta-carotene,C0053396,"A natural pigment synthesized by plants, beta-carotene is used as an antioxidant, as an immunostimulant, and to prevent or treat cancer, AIDS, heart disease, and leukoplakia. Beta-carotene, along with alpha-carotene and beta-cryptoxanthin, can be converted to retinol and is classified as a provitamin A carotenoid. Supplementation with beta-carotene does not increase overall vitamin A levels or lead to vitamin A toxicity. Available data of beta-carotene supplementation for HIV-positive patients and its effects on CD4 counts as well as cardiovascular disease are conflicting. A meta-analysis demonstrated a small but significant increase in all-cause mortality and cardiovascular death for the beta-carotene arm over placebo , whereas other studies reported no such effects nor any benefits of beta-carotene supplementation against cardiovascular disease , or its risk factors . However, higher intake of fruits and vegetables, but not antioxidant supplements, reduced intra-abdominal visceral fat and was associated with reduced risk of cardiovascular disease, total cancer, and all-cause mortality . Supplementation (with or without vitamin A) may actually increase the risk of cardiovascular mortality . Beta-carotene has also been inversely correlated with metabolic syndrome . Another meta-analysis did not find any correlation between beta-carotene supplementation and hematologic malignancies . Consistent associations between serum beta-carotene levels and risk of developing type 2 diabetes are lacking as well . Additional studies have reported beta-carotene to protect adults under 40 years from seasonal influenza virus when used with Levilactobacillus brevis KB290 ; serum beta-carotene to be inversely associated with the incidence of cataract formation ; higher intake of β-carotene (while avoiding vitamin C supplements) to be associated with lowered risk of acquired hearing loss in women ; high dietary intake to have a protective effect on buccal cells from relative telomere length (RTL) shortening . Data on the effects of supplementation for preventing cognitive decline are conflicting . Epidemiological associations between beta-carotene and cancer risk are conflicting. Whereas high dietary intake was associated with reduced risk of cervical cancer ; and limited evidence suggesting an inverse association with overall survival in breast cancer patients , high serum levels were correlated with increased risk of aggressive prostate cancer , but with reduced risk of aggressive urothelial cell carcinoma . Findings of beta-carotene and chemoprevention are inconsistent as well. Consumption of beta carotene, vitamins A, C, fruits and vegetables did not influence the risk of renal cell carcinoma ; supplementation with antioxidants, beta-carotene and vitamins A, C, and E, did not prevent gastrointestinal cancer, and beta-carotene may actually increase risk of lung cancer and overall mortality . Data from large, multi-center trials suggest that supplementation may not lower the risk of prostate cancer ; and in male smokers over the age 40, it may increase lung cancer incidence , regardless of the tar or nicotine content of cigarettes smoked . When combined with cigarette smoking, beta-carotene supplements may also reduce the efficacy of cancer therapies, resulting in increased recurrence and mortality . Additional data from a large-scale cohort study suggest that alcohol consumption, too, has a negative effect on the chemopreventive property of beta-carotene . Furthermore, long-term supplementation may not have a meaningful effect on total or cancer mortality more than a decade after supplementation ends . The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends against beta-carotene or vitamin E supplements for the prevention of cardiovascular disease or cancer .",,"Beta-carotene has strong antioxidant effects, and protects lipid peroxidation and provitamin-A activity, thereby preventing oxidative damage (34). It was also shown to alleviate the severity of ulcerative colitis in a murine model by modulating several molecular targets including nuclear factor-kappa B, cyclooxygenase-2, interleukin 17, and connective tissue growth factor (35).
In other studies, beta-carotene reduced cell growth and induced apoptosis in a variety of cancer cell lines through caveolin-1 expression (20). It also induces glutathione production (21); enhances macrophage function and natural killer (NK) cell cytotoxicity; and increases T-helper lymphocyte counts. However, clinical findings suggest that beta-carotene can increase cancer risk. It was shown to induce angiogenic gene expression in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) as well as HUVEC migration (22); and stimulate cellular proliferation in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (23) as well as in lung cancer cells (24).

Vitamin E acts as an antioxidant and is thought to help prevent and treat many diseases. Although it is available in a variety of formulations, only the d-isomer is considered active .Studies suggest Vitamin E may slow the progression of Alzheimer’s disease . However, long-term supplementation did not reduce incidence of dementia or slow cognitive deterioration , and another study does not support the utility of antioxidants (vitamin E, vitamin C, lipoid acid, and Coenzyme Q) for Alzheimer’s disease . It was also ineffective in arresting the development or progression of macular degeneration and early Parkinson’s Disease .Vitamin E did not decrease the incidence of acute respiratory tract infections , reduce mortality, or reduce the risk of cardiovascular death or cerebrovascular accident . When taken along with vitamin C, vitamin E may increase mortality and nonfatal myocardial infarction in patients with coronary artery disease . Further, findings from the recent Physicians’ Health Study II show that neither vitamin E nor C is beneficial in preventing cardiovascular events, and vitamin E may actually increase stroke risk . The Women’s Health Study also failed to find any benefit of vitamin E supplementation in lowering the risk of heart failure in healthy women . A meta-analysis showed that vitamin E increases the risk for hemorrhagic stroke but reduces the risk of ischemic stroke . Vitamin E may reduce symptoms of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis in adults , but not in children and adolescents .Vitamin E may have a preventive effect on bone loss in postmenopausal osteopenic women and improve male infertility .Limited studies on Vitamin E to improve symptoms in cancer patients suggest it may help relieve hot flashes in breast cancer survivors and prevent symptoms of CIPN , reduce incidence of cisplatin-induced neurotoxicity , and prevent radiodermatitis in breast cancer patients .Data on whether Vitamin E supplementation can reduce cancer risk are mixed , and some studies even suggest it may increase cancer risk . In prostate cancer, data from the SELECT trial showed that vitamin E alone or with selenium for 5 years did not reduce prostate cancer risk , and significantly increased risk at 7 years’ follow-up . Vitamin E taken with soy and selenium also did not prevent prostate cancer progression . Some studies suggest an association between dietary tocopherol and reduced risks for lung and liver cancers. In addition, a meta-analysis supports dietary intake of various nutrients including alpha-tocopherol, but not antioxidant supplement use, for chronic disease prevention .Toxicity may occur with chronic supplementation of vitamin E in doses greater than 800 IU. Daily supplementation over 400 IU may increase all-cause mortality . Vitamin E may also enhance the activity of warfarin. In a large study of patients treated with warfarin, higher serum vitamin E levels predicted hemorrhagic events .",,"Vitamin E is a fat-soluble vitamin that acts as an antioxidant. The natural form of vitamin E is composed of 4 different tocopherols and 4 different tocotrienol homologues (alpha, beta, delta, and gamma). All 8 forms have antioxidant activity, but recent data indicate the different homologues have different activities unrelated to antioxidant effects (34).Gamma-tocopherol is a stronger inhibitor of cyclooxygenase and traps reactive oxygen species more effectively than alpha-tocopherol. In vitro and in vivo, gamma-tocopherol exhibits antiproliferative and proapoptotic effects whereas alpha-tocopherol does not (34). While both alpha- and gamma-tocopherols exhibit anti-inflammatory effects in vitro and in vivo, gamma-enriched mixed tocopherols may have more activity than alpha-tocopherols. This may help explain the negative outcomes of recent large-scale intervention studies that used only the alpha homologue (34).The d-alpha-tocopherol isomer is believed to be the active principle. Natural vitamin E supplements contain d-alpha-tocopherol derived from plant oil sources, whereas synthetic supplements are composed of a racemic mixture of d- and l-alpha-tocopherols. The major function of d-alpha-tocopherol is to prevent the propagation of free radical reactions by acting as a peroxyl radical scavenger and protecting polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) in membrane phospholipids and plasma lipoproteins. Alpha-tocopherol reportedly causes inhibition of protein kinase C activity, which is involved in cell proliferation and differentiation in smooth muscle cells, human platelets, and monocytes. Vitamin E enrichment of endothelial cells downregulates expression of intercellular and vascular cell adhesion molecules to decrease adhesion of blood cell components to the endothelium. Vitamin E also upregulates expression of cytosolic phospholipase A2 and cyclooxegenase-1, which leads to release of prostacyclin, a vasodilator and inhibitor of platelet aggregation in humans (3).In an animal study, vitamin E increased lung cancer cell proliferation due to its antioxidant activity by reducing reactive oxygen species, DNA damage, and p53 expression (47).","dl-alpha Tocopheryl acetate | Glycine max - Seed | Plant-derived oils (wheat germ, soybean, sunflower, almond, safflower, corn), wheat germ, liver, eggs, nuts and seeds, green leafy vegetables, whole grains (1) (2)",Tocopherol | Alpha-tocopherol | dl-tocopherol | Tocotrienol | RRR-alpha-tocopherol,Vitamin E | Mixed tocopherol concentrate,Vitamin E (unspecified) | Vitamin E (Alpha-Tocomonoenol) | Vitamin E | Vitamin E (mixed) | Vitamin E (beta-tocopherol) | Vitamin E (tocopherol not specified) | Vitamin E (not specified) | Vitamin E (gamma unspecified),Vitamin E,

DSI000192,N-acetyl-L-cysteine,C0001047,"N-acetylcysteine (NAC) is an antioxidant that is used as a prescription drug and as a dietary supplement. As a drug, it is given parenterally or orally to treat acetaminophen overdose. It also has other clinical applications. For example, the inhalant and oral solution forms have a mucolytic effect, and are used to relieve obstructions in bronchial diseases and in tracheotomy procedures. The oral capsule is marketed as a dietary supplement for its liver-protective properties and to support healthy immune functioning. Clinical studies show that NAC can treat drug-induced hepatotoxicity . For prevention of contrast-induced acute kidney injury, a meta-analysis found misleading beneficial associations that were lost when analysis was restricted to larger studies , and mechanistic studies showed that oral NAC is poorly absorbed with no renoprotective effects . Results with NAC for chronic lung disease are mixed. Some studies suggest it can reduce exacerbations , inflammation , and help improve or maintain lung function , but such benefits were not observed in other trials . In addition, a meta-analysis suggests it is not the most effective mucolytic agent for COPD . There has also been interest in using NAC to improve psychiatric conditions, but studies are mixed on whether it can help conditions such as compulsive disorders or depression . Although small studies suggest that NAC may inhibit cancer biomarker development , a large trial found it did not inhibit formation of secondary head and neck or lung tumors . Other preliminary findings suggest NAC may help reduce cancer treatment-related side effects such as liver toxicity , neuropathy , mucositis , or poor hematopoietic function , but it did not reduce oxidative stress or cisplatin toxicities . It is also unclear whether NAC, as an antioxidant, may alter cancer treatment effectiveness. Gastrointestinal side effects have been reported and unpleasant product odor that required masking has been noted . Although it is generally known for its safety profile, NAC supplementation in an animal model appeared to accelerate lung cancer growth . Therefore additional studies are needed to determine safety, feasibility, and efficacy.",,"NAC is a precursor to glutathione (GSH). It is used as both an antidote for acetaminophen-induced hepatotoxicity, and as a mucolytic agent for respiratory diseases. NAC reduces disulphide bonds to sulfhydryl bonds to reduce mucus formation (20). Its hepatoprotective action may occur by cytokine-mediated mechanisms as well as GSH replenishment (21). NAC crosses the blood-brain barrier, increases brain GSH levels, and acts as a glutamine modulator (11).
In vitro, NAC improved ifosfamide benefits by decreasing nephrotoxicity without reducing antitumor effects (26). NAC altered doxorubicin-induced NF-κB activity via concentration-dependent anti- and pro-oxidant mechanisms (27). This biphasic effect was also time-dependent (28). In androgen-independent human prostate cancer PC-3 cells, antiproliferative effects were attributed to upregulated Cyr61 protein expression (28).
Other mechanistic studies show that oral NAC is poorly absorbed with no renoprotective effects (53).

It is widely used in herbal therapy and promoted as a dietary supplement to help improve eyesight and promote overall eye health. The anthocyanins in bilberry are thought to regenerate rhodopsin, a pigment present in retinal photoreceptor cells. Preclinical studies suggest bilberry polyphenols protect against neurodegenerative processes and eye disorders , as well as help visual functioning and protect against retinal diseases . Small studies indicate that bilberry fruit improves visual function in individuals with normal tension glaucoma and relieves tonic accommodation of the ciliary muscle caused by visual display terminal and near-vision tasks , but others produced mixed data with a systematic review citing the need for well-designed trials . Additional studies found a standardized bilberry extract reduced disease activity in patients with mild to moderate ulcerative colitis and a bilberry formulation was effective against hemorrhoidal disease . Dietary bilberry also altered lipid profiles and improved glucose metabolism in individuals at high risk for type 2 diabetes and produced beneficial changes in serum lipids and lipoproteins in women with higher metabolic risk, but had an unexpected opposite effect in women at low risk . Bilberry fruit may decrease biomarkers of inflammation indicative of reduced cardiometabolic risk in the long term , but whether it lowers the risk of cardiovascular disease is not clear . Bilberry consumption resulted in small to moderate increases in exercise-induced delayed onset muscle soreness and C-reactive Protein . Bilberry showed anticancer effects in preclinical models and protected against chemo-induced oral mucositis . Preliminary findings suggest bilberry extract reduces proliferation of colorectal cancer cells and a proprietary mixed herbal extract relieves chemo/radiotherapy-induced mucositis in pediatric and adult cancer patients . However, the extent to which bilberry itself was responsible for such effects is unclear.",,"In vitro, bilberry polyphenols inhibited amyloid fibril formation and dissolved preformed toxic aggregates and mature fibrils, suggesting a role in controlling fibril formations of various proteins that occur with neurodegenerative diseases (1). Bilberry anthocyanins modulated oxidative stress defense enzymes heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) and glutathione S-transferase-pi (GST-pi) in human retinal pigment epithelial cells (2). In vitro and in vivo, bilberry inhibited angiogenesis through inhibition of ERK 1/2 and Akt phosphorylation (4). In an animal model of uveitis and retinal inflammation, pretreatment with a bilberry extract prevented photoreceptor impairment, relieved intracellular ROS elevation, activated retinal NF-ĸB in the inflamed retina, and suppressed the decrease of rhodopsin via inhibition of IL-6, which activates STAT3, thereby protecting outer segment length in photoreceptor cells (3). In a monocytic cell line, quercetin, epicatechin, and resveratrol inhibited lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced NF-kappaB activation (14).
In individuals with hypercholesterolemia, anthocyanins may improve endothelium-dependent vasodilation by activating the NO-cGMP signaling pathway (28). The polyphenols in bilberry juice can modulate inflammation by decreasing plasma C-reactive protein, interleukin (IL)-6, -15, and monokine induced by INFγ (MIG) (14).
In human colon and liver cancer cell lines, bilberry anthocyanins demonstrated intracellular antioxidant activity even though concentrations applied were very low (29). Bilberry extract inhibited human leukemia, colon, and breast cancer cells through apoptotic induction and/or inhibition of cell proliferation (17) (30).

It often is used in combination with other botanicals such as PC-SPES and sho-saiko-to. Preclinical data suggest that compounds in S. baicalensis cause apoptosis in various cancer cells or protect against doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity . However, both S. baicalensis root and its main flavonoid baicalin appear to have dose-dependent pro- and anti-angiogenic effects . Some constituents may also have neuroprotective , anticonvulsant , and anti-inflammatory effects. Studies in humans are quite limited. A preliminary study of S. baicalensis along with metformin appeared to improved glucose tolerance, inflammation, and gut microbiota in patients with type 2 diabetes . An herbal supplement containing S. baicalensis reduced symptoms of osteoarthritis . However, it is not known if the herb would exert similar effects by itself, and cases of hepatotoxicity with some supplements have been reported .",,"In vitro, the flavonoid baicalin exhibits anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and gram-positive antibacterial activity (3). In animal models, attenuation of asthma was attributed to reduced airway injury and restored mitochondrial function (19). Neuroprotective effects of flavonoids were ameliorated by diazepam, a GABA receptor agonist, suggesting that the components influence GABA receptor activity (5).
Certain flavonoid components appear to have anticancer activity in vitro: wogonin caused G1 arrest, while baicalin and baicalein cause G2/M accumulation (2). Baicalin also activated caspase-3, resulting in apoptosis of leukemia-derived T cells. However, low doses of baicalin upregulated expression of multiple angiogenic genes to increase cell proliferation in developing blood vessels, while high doses inhibited angiogenesis by inducing cell death, suggesting dose-dependent dual effects.

DSI000205,L-Theanine,C0076380,"L-theanine is a water soluble amino acid found in green tea and mushrooms. Purified L-theanine is available as an oral dietary supplement, and is used for its perceived antioxidant and relaxant effects . Preclinical studies suggest neuroprotective and enhanced chemotherapeutic effects as well as reduced chemotoxicity , but L-theanine may also alter neurotransmitter levels . Data in humans are limited. Small studies suggest improvements in sleep , but effects on anxiety are mixed . Epidemiological data suggest green tea consumption may contribute to stroke prevention , but it is unclear whether L-theanine alone may confer this benefit. Other preliminary data suggest oral theanine along with cystine may reduce neuropathy in patients receiving oxaliplatin . Patients undergoing chemotherapy should discuss the use of L-theanine with their physicians because most purported effects are not based on clinical trials, and epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) in green tea reduces activity of the chemotherapy drug bortezomib.",,"As a non-protein amino acid, L-theanine crosses the blood-brain barrier, exerting various neurophysiological and pharmacological effects including: anxiolytic and calming effects, due to inhibitory neurotransmitters and selective serotonin and dopamine modulation; cognitive improvements perhaps through decreased NMDA-dependent CA1 long-term potentiation (LTP) and increased NMDA-independent CA1-LTP; and improved selective attention during mental tasks likely due to changes in alpha brain wave activity (25). Neuroprotective effects are also thought to be due to its selective binding to glutamate receptors (2).
In animal models, L-theanine appears to have a dose-dependent biphasic effect on NSAID-induced gastric ulcers, delaying healing at higher doses (40 mg/kg), but accelerating healing at lower doses (10 mg/kg) perhaps through the maintenance of glutathione levels thus protecting against oxidative damage (26).
In human studies, L-theanine attenuated effects of caffeine on oxygenated hemoglobin, cognition, and mood, suggesting both independent and interactive effects between the two compounds (22). Other studies suggest that combining caffeine and theanine intake causes their individual effects to counteract each other (30) (31). L-theanine also stabilizes glutamatergic concentrations in the brain, which may explain its therapeutic effect in patients with schizophrenia (21).
L-theanine was shown to increase the antitumor activity of chemotherapeutic drugs doxorubicin and idarubicin (5) (6). These agents normally bind the glutamate receptor and the complex is transported across the cell resulting in reduced concentrations, hence attenuating effects of these drugs. Consequent mechanistic studies revealed that L-theanine, a glutamate analogue, competes with glutamate to bind the glutamate receptor, resulting in suppression of chemotherapy efflux (extracellular transport), increasing their concentration (27).
Mechanisms by which L-theanine may reduce doxorubicin adverse effects may include the variance of glutamate receptors expressed in normal and tumor cells. Whereas theanine binds the glutamate receptor in tumor cells, it is metabolized to glutamate in normal cells. This increase in glutamate likely results in increased efflux of doxorubicin from the cells, thereby decreasing toxicity (28). Animal models suggest prevention of doxorubicin-induced acute hepatotoxicity occurs via suppression of intrinsic caspase-3-dependent apoptotic signaling (24).

Preliminary data suggest it has antiosteoporotic effects and enhances bone formation . Black cohosh by itself or in combination with other herbs may be effective for menopausal symptoms, although data are conflicting and an older meta analysis cited insufficient evidence to support its use . However, a more recent meta-analysis found isopropanolic black cohosh extract, an herbal medicinal product widely used in the EU as nonhormonal therapy, is comparable to low-dose transdermal estradiol or tibolone with a better benefit-risk profile than tibolone . Investigations of black cohosh for hot flashes due to breast cancer treatment also yielded mixed results , but supplementation may be effective for menopausal syndrome induced by luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone analogue . In other studies, black cohosh did not enhance bone density, improve menopausal symptoms, nor improve 10-year risk of coronary heart disease in early postmenopausal women , although it has been reported to improve sleep . Preclinical data suggest black cohosh may decrease proliferation of prostate cancer cells and induce an apoptotic response in liver cells , but it also increased incidence of metastatic disease in mice . Whether it has similar effects in breast cancer patients is not clear, and a retrospective observational study of breast cancer patients found that isopropanolic black cohosh extract enhanced disease-free survival . Concomitant use of black cohosh with prescription medications has been associated with adverse drug reactions, most commonly involving abnormal hepatic function, hepatitis or hepatotoxicity . Black cohosh should not be confused with blue cohosh, which has a different medicinal profile. It is also not clear whether or not black cohosh acts as a phytoestrogen. Patients with breast cancer or at risk of breast cancer should consult with their physicians before taking it.",,"Black cohosh relieves menopausal symptoms likely by mimicking neurostransmitters: dopaminergic, noradrenergic, serotoninergic and GABAergic effects have been demonstrated (49). It was believed to have estrogenic effects due to its ability to relieve menopausal symptoms in women (40), but studies show it has no effect on LH, FSH, prolactin, or estradiol levels (24). A black cohosh extract had antiproliferative and antiestrogenic effects in ER-negative cells, which suggests effects are mediated via an estrogen-independent pathway (25), possibly through HER-2 signaling (26).
In other studies, black cohosh repressed cyclin D1 and ID3 expression and inhibited proliferation of HepG2 p53-positive liver cells (43). In prostate cancer cells, antiproliferative effects occurred via impaired equilibrative nucleoside transporter activity, resulting in hindered nucleoside uptake (50). Black cohosh also induced apoptosis and suppressed estradiol-induced cell proliferation in human endometrial adenocarcinoma cells (55).
Hepatotoxicity is a major concern with black cohosh use. Evaluation of liver biopsies from two patients who took black cohosh supplements showed pathological injury identical to toxic necrosis, seen during autoimmune hepatitis (51).",Root,Black snakeroot | Rattlesnake root | Squawroot,Actaea racemosa | Cimicifuga racemosa,Black Cohosh,Black Cohosh,

DSI000215,Garcinia gummi-gutta,C3587021,"Garcinia gummi-gutta, better known by its older name Garcinia cambogia, is a plant native to Southeast Asia. The fruit rinds have antioxidant and anticholinesterase activities , and are used as a flavoring agent and in traditional medicine to treat gastrointestinal ailments. The extract, rich in hydroxycitric acid (HCA), can be found in many products promoted for weight loss or body building. In animal studies, G. cambogia increased satiety, fatty acid oxidation, and weight loss and seemed to protect against high-fat and high-sugar diets . An ethanol extract of garcinia also showed erythropoietic effects . In humans, clinical trials are limited. HCA did not decrease caloric intake, promote satiety, or affect fat oxidation , but improved glycogen synthesis and insulin sensitivity in a small study . Other preliminary data suggest garcinia may improve HDL levels, but have minimal effects on other plasma lipids . Results from RCTs are mixed, but show no significant effect of G. cambogia extract over placebo for weight reduction . A combination of G. cambogia with orlistat had more effects on cardiometabolic profiles and visceral adiposity index than orlistat alone in obese patients . G. cambogia and HCA supplements have been associated with liver toxicity, mania, and herb-drug interactions. Patients who have cancer, diabetes, depression, or other chronic diseases, or women who are pregnant should use G. cambogia with caution. G. cambogia should not be confused with Garcinia mangostana (Mangosteen).",,"The negative isomer of hydroxycitric acid ((-)-HCA), may be the most active chemical compound of G. cambogia fruit rind. HCA is theorized to affect weight loss via decreased fatty acid synthesis, appetite suppression, and increased fatty acid metabolism. It competitively inhibits ATP-citrate lyase, the enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of citrate to substrates for fatty acid synthesis (3). Increased citrates in the cytoplasm may reduce glycolysis and increase glycogen synthesis. ATP-citrate lyase is also upregulated in cancer cells with high levels of aerobic glycolysis (18).
An animal study observed decreases in leptin and insulin levels in obese mice treated with HCA, which may suggest alterations in glucose metabolism (4). The iron contents in G. cambogia may contribute to the erythropoietic effect observed in animals (7).",Fruit | Fruit peel,Garcinia | Tamarind | Brindleberry | Hydroxycitric acid | HCA | Hydroxycut,Garcinia gummi-gutta | Garcinia gummi-guta | Garcinia gummi-gutta - Fruit peel,,Garcinia gummi-gutta,

DSI000218,Valeriana officinalis,C0993600,"Derived from the root of the plant V. officinalis, valerian is sold as a dietary supplement for calmness, sedation, and to improve sleep quality. Other species including V. jatamansi, V. fauriei, and V. wallichii are also used in traditional medicine to treat insomnia and anxiety. Valerian products are usually available in extracts or teas that have a distinct odor.In preclinical studies, valerian showed antioxidant , cytoprotective , neuroprotective , antihypertensive, antispasmotic , anxiolytic , and antidepressant , but not sedative effects.Clinical findings indicate improvements in anxiety and sleep quality , but the sleep-inducing properties were not superior to placebo . Valerian also failed to improve sleep in a study of cancer patients . Other studies suggest valerian may improve sleep and anxiety in HIV patients on antiretroviral therapy , reduce hot flashes and dysmenorrhea , facilitate supervised benzodiazepine withdrawal , relieve symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder , and have a positive affect on mental energy . However, sample sizes in these studies were too small to draw firm conclusions. Other reviews also concluded the evidence for valerian as an anxiolytic is insufficient .The valerian derivative isovaleroxy-hydroxy dihydrovaltrate showed anticancer effects against human ovarian cancer cells in vitro and in vivo . Chlorovaltrates in valerian had moderate cytotoxicity against lung, prostate, colon and liver cancer cell lines . But a case-control study found valerian to be positively associated with risk of early-onset colorectal cancer . Clinical trials have yet to be conducted.Although valerian products are generally safe, liver and pancreatic toxicities have been reported . Valerian is also thought to have estrogenic effects , but this was not observed in vitro .",,"In vitro, valerian protects against lipid peroxidation, deoxyribose degradation, and ROS production (1). Iridoids, germacrane-type sesquiterpenoids, and lignans in valerian are associated with neuroprotective effects (3) (34). Valerian constituents also bind to various neurotransmitter receptors implicated in circadian rhythms and anxiety such as serotonin receptors (35). Preclinical studies found that anxiolytic activity is due to valerenic acid (VA) which could be inhibited by derivatives such as hydroxy-VA that do not modulate GABAA receptors (36). VA inhibits the enzyme system responsible for central catabolism of GABA, increasing GABA concentration and decreasing CNS activity, and direct binding of this constituent to GABA-receptors has been demonstrated (37). VA interaction with the GABAAergic system is similar to that of benzodiazepines (6). Sesquiterpenes and valepotriates were identified as having varying levels of antidepressant activity (7) (38). Chronic treatment of rodents with valepotriate-rich extract increased norepinephrine and dopamine levels (38). Valerian showed antispasmodic and hypotensive effects via potassium channel activation, which may be useful in gastrointestinal and cardiovascular disorders (5). It also protected against vasopressin-induced coronary spasm and pressor response, suggestive of coronary and systemic vasodilation (4).In healthy volunteers, valerian modulated intracortical facilitatory circuits (55). Valerian iridoids have choleretic activity and may increase the risk of gallstone formation (27).",Root | Valeriana officinalis,Garden valerian | Indian valerian | Pacific valerian | Mexican valerian,Valeriana officinalis | Valerian,Capitate Valerian | Indian Valerian | Valerian,Valerian,

DSI000228,Propolis,C0033488,"Propolis is a resinous mixture of pollen and beeswax collected by honeybees from the buds and exudates of certain trees and plants . It has been used in folk medicine, food, and beverages to improve health and prevent disease. Preclinical studies suggest antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, immunostimulatory, vasomodulatory, cardio- and radioprotective properties . It also demonstrated anticancer activities in several human cancer cell lines . Other experiments suggest it might enhance temozolomide effects in human glioblastoma cells . Data in humans are limited. Small trials suggest propolis may help treat warts , fungal foot infections , or diabetic foot ulcers . It may also reduce microbial counts and improve symptoms following periodontal treatment . A propolis/zinc suspension reduced the number of acute otitis media infections in children and supplementation with cranberry and propolis may help reduce the incidence of urinary tract infections . A double-blind RCT did not find benefit with Brazilian propolis for rheumatoid arthritis . In cancer settings, supplemental propolis was not useful for colon cancer prevention, and had negative effects on muscle tissues including myocardial cells . Its effects on chemotherapy-induced mucositis are thus far equivocal . Bee pollen, a constituent of propolis, is a mixture of plant pollens, nectar, and bee saliva that bees form into granules to store as food . It is claimed as a “cure all” by some and touted as having antioxidant, antiaging, and stamina-increasing properties. Aside from nutritional value, it had limited effects on athletic performance . Propolis or its constituents may also act as pro-oxidants , produce cytotoxic effects in normal cells , and/or have mutagenic activity , indicating that risk versus benefit needs further evaluation.",,"In vitro studies have identified a number of active propolis constituents and potential mechanisms. Generally, antimicrobial and antioxidant activities are related to total phenolic contents (15). Caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE) and artepillin C are well-known anti-inflammatory components (25). The main active anticancer constituents are CAPE and chrysin (23). However, all of these constituents possess these other characteristics to some degree and vary with geographic origin.
CAPE specifically inhibits NF-kB (41). In human breast cancer cells, it also inhibits MDR gene expression, EGFR, and VEGF (20). CAPE decreased malignancy potential of breast cancer stem cells via inhibition of self-renewal, progenitor formation, and clonal growth, and significantly decreased CD44 expression (42). CAPE-initiated S- and G2/M-phase cell-cycle arrests and apoptosis in human cervical cancer lines was associated with increased E2F-1 expression (43).
The flavonoid chrysin demonstrated photoprotective effects by attenuating UVA- and UVB-induced apoptosis, ROS production, and COX-2 expression (44). Chrysin inhibits aromatase, an enzyme converting testosterone into estrogen (39), as well as histone deacetylase and HDAC8 enzymatic activity (23). Chrysin may overcome TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) resistance through Mcl-1 downregulation via STAT3 phosphorylation inhibition (45).
The phenolic compound artepillin C is the major constituent that stimulates pungent taste by activating TRPA1 channels (47). Immunomodulating effects are attributed to suppression of IL-2, IFN-γ and IL-17 expression in alloreactive CD4 T cells, suggesting potential to treat graft versus host disease (48). Artepillin C also sensitizes prostate cancer cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis by engaging both extrinsic receptor-mediated and intrinsic mitochondrial apoptotic pathways (21). In different tumor cell lines, artepillin C and baccharin were more cytotoxic than propolis, without additive or synergistic effects when combined (49).
Propolis as a whole modulates key inflammatory mediators of mRNA transcription, inhibiting specific inflammatory cytokines, and blocking NF-kB activation (55). Synergy between propolis and temozolomide in human glioblastoma cell lines is also partly attributed to reduced NF-kB activity (18). Propolis also inhibited proliferation of human leukemia cells via caspase-3 activation (2).
In animal models, propolis promotes wound healing via downregulation of type I allergy and inflammation (25) and modifying fibronectin metabolism (26). Immunomodulatory effects occur through increased toll-like receptor expression and IL-1β and IL-6 production (12). Pretreatment with orally-administered propolis extract reduced doxorubicin-induced oxidative damage to heart mitochondria (3). Diabetic hepatorenal damage was attenuated via antioxidant activity including free-radical scavenging, and was more pronounced in ethanol than water extracts (56).",Apis mellifera - secretion | Gum secreted by bee | Bee hive of the honey bee (Apis mellifera) | Apis mellifera - secretion,Bee propolis | Propolis resin | Propolis wax | Bee glue | Bee putty,Propolis | Green bee propolis | Bee Propolis | Bee propolis,Bee Propolis | Propolis,Propolis,

DSI000230,L-Leucine,C0023401,"Leucine is an essential amino acid that is not synthesized in the human body, and must be obtained from food consisting of plant or animal protein. It is often used together with valine and isoleucine (branched-chain amino acids, BCAA) in parenteral forms for nutritional support to maintain nitrogen balance and to treat cirrhosis and hepatic encephalopathy. Purified leucine is marketed as a dietary supplement for body building. It is thought to stimulate protein synthesis by activating the mTOR pathway . In various animal models, leucine supplementation improved leptin sensitivity , lipid and glucose metabolism , exercise tolerance , acquired growth hormone resistance , disease-related skeletal muscle dysfunctions , and anemia . Although studies of leucine-containing products suggest potential benefit for improving muscle mass and strength across various populations, results are mixed , and a systematic review cites high heterogeneity across trial designs and formulas used . Other studies have shown that leucine does not affect glycemic control in elderly diabetic men , although in healthy subjects and in the presence of glucose, it stimulates insulin secretion and lowered blood glucose levels . Preliminary data suggest that essential amino acids with high levels of leucine may help prevent muscle loss in patients with non small-cell lung cancer . The addition of a leucine-rich supplement to a multimodal therapy also improved handgrip strength, but not other measures of physical functioning in advanced cancer patients .",,"Leucine is an essential branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) associated with skeletal muscle growth and maintenance, energy production, and generation of neurotransmitter and gluconeogenic precursors (35). It stimulates protein synthesis by activating the mTOR pathway (1), and is thought to enhance muscle anabolic signaling (11).
Animal models indicate that BCAA metabolism-related gene expression is regulated during adipocyte differentiation and influenced by nutrient levels, and leucine supplementation induces Bcat2 and Bckdha genes during early and late differentiation (35). Insulin sensitivity was improved in mice fed a high-fat diet by decreasing adiposity, rather than through direct action on peripheral target organs (36). Supplementation also improved lipid and glucose metabolism and restored leptin sensitivity in previously obese animals (19). However, in already-obese rats, leucine worsened adiposity by encouraging hypothalamic gene expression that favored fat accumulation (37). In another study, it did not reduce food intake or induce an anorectic pattern of hypothalamic gene expression (38). Co-ingesting leucine and glycine markedly attenuated glucose response, with only a modest increase in insulin response, suggesting their effects on glucose metabolism are partially insulin-independent (39). Leucine along with subtherapeutic levels of a PDE5 inhibitor altered lipid metabolism from storage to oxidation, improved glycemic control, and reversed hepatic steatosis induced by high-fat feeding (40).
Leucine supplementation speeds connective tissue repair and muscle regeneration by attenuating transforming growth factor-beta type I receptor and activating Smad2/3 (41). Antiatrophic effects were not mediated by its metabolite, beta-hydroxy-beta-methyl butyrate, and did not occur in dexamethasone-treated rats (42).
The ability of leucine to improve anemia in ribosomal protein-deficient cells occurs independently of TP53 (23). In Diamond-Blackfan anemia patients, leucine modulated protein synthesis by enhancing translation leading to improved hemoglobin levels (7). In the skeletal muscle of cirrhotic patients, an oral leucine-enriched BCAA mixture increased autophagy and reversed impaired mTOR1 signaling (24). Leucine may have a protective role in attenuating macrophage foam-cell formation, a hallmark of early atherogenesis, via mechanisms related to the metabolism of cholesterol, triglycerides, and energy production (49).","L-Leucine | Anas falcata - feather | L-Leucine | L-Leucine | Plant and animal proteins including dairy, fish, soy, meat, poultry, beans, and eggs",L-leucine | Leucinum | L-alpha-aminoisocaproic acid | Branched-chain amino acid (BCAA),L-Leucine | L-leucine | (S)-2-Amino-4-methylpentanoic acid | L-2-amino-4-methylvaleric acid,Creatyl-l-leucine | Glycyl-Alanyl-Lysine-L-Leucine | Glycine-alanyl-l-leucine | Glycyl-Alanyl-L-Leucine | Leucine | L-Leucine | Leucine tripeptide | leucine nitrate | leucine-alanine | N-acetyl leucine,Leucine,

The edible fruit is used both as food and in medicine to treat diabetes, cancer, viral infections, and immune disorders. Its bitterness is attributed to the presence of alkaloids, momordicosides, and momordicines. In vitro and animal studies suggest anticancer , antiviral , antidiabetic , and lipid-lowering effects. Data in humans are limited. Although bitter melon may lower blood sugar levels in both pre-diabetic and diabetic patients , meta-analyses conclude the evidence is low quality with sparse safety data , and that more robust studies are needed . Other preliminary data suggest supplementation may improve symptoms in knee osteoarthritis patients . In a study of cervical cancer patients, bitter melon had no effect on natural killer cell activity . Although bitter melon is consumed as food, ingesting the seeds, extracts, and large quantities of juice can cause adverse effects.",,"In an animal model, bitter melon extract showed hypoglycemic activity by suppressing glucose-6-phosphatase and fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase enzymes in the liver (14). It improved insulin sensitivity, glucose tolerance, and insulin signaling (15). It also reduced insulin resistance by influencing PPAR alpha and gamma expression (16) and by modulating phosphorylation status of insulin receptors and downstream signaling molecules (17). Preventive effects against insulin resistance may also occur via modulation of NF-kappa B and JNK pathways (36).
Animals fed bitter melon showed lower fatty acid synthase (18). It may affect fat and carbohydrate metabolism by stimulating thyroid hormones and adiponectin, and by enhancing AMPK activity (19). In another study, it prevented inflammation and oxidative stress, modulated mitochondrial activity, suppressed apoptosis activation, and inhibited lipid accumulation during the development of fatty liver (32).
Other experiments suggest cytotoxic activity with isolated components such as ribosome-inactivating proteins which inhibited HDAC-1 activity and induced apoptosis in prostate cancer cells (1). A triterpene extracted from bitter melon activated PPAR gamma and induced apoptosis in breast cancer cells (20). Bitter melon juice also caused apoptosis by inducing caspase-3 activation through AMPK in pancreatic cell lines (3). Similar effects were observed with methanol extracts which increased Bax and decreased the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2 (21) (22). Other studies demonstrated reduction in metastasis via suppression of MMP-2 and MMP-9 enzymatic activities in lung adenocarcinoma cells (23). Bitter melon juice decreased phosphorylation of protein kinases Akt and ERK1/2, and viability of gemcitabine-resistant pancreatic cancer cells (37).",Fruit,Bitter gourd | Bitter cucumber | Bitter apple | Balsam pear | Leprosy gourd,Momordica charantia,Bitter Melon | Balsam pear,Bitter Melon,

The use of silver medicinals to treat disorders such as epilepsy, gonorrhea, and colds was not uncommon until the mid-20th century. However, silver was replaced by safer therapies in the recent decades. It is not an essential mineral and does not serve any physiological function in the body. It denatures proteins by binding to their reactive groups and can inactivate some enzymes by forming hemisilver sulfides with sulfhydryl groups of the enzymes . A small study did not find any benefits of a colloidal silver nasal spray in improving recalcitrant chronic rhinosinusitis . Whereas silver compounds are still used in external preparations as antiseptics, there has been a growing interest in using the colloidal form, orally, as an alternative medicine. In vitro studies indicate antitumor effects , but no human data support the use of oral colloidal silver. Despite lack of evidence, it is being promoted as a cure for AIDS, cancer, and diabetes. Long term use can cause silver deposition in the skin and mucous membranes leading to an irreversible condition called argyria, characterized by bluish-gray to gray-black pigmentation . Other adverse effects include seizures . Pregnant women should not consume colloidal silver as it can cause developmental abnormalities in the fetus . The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has warned companies marketing products, including colloidal silver, with false claims of preventing or treating the coronavirus disease COVID-19 .",,"Silver is unstable in suspension form and can bind to proteins. Silver compounds form hemisilver sulfides with sulfhydryl groups that leads to inactivation of enzymes. Silver also has the ability to bind amino, carboxyl, phosphate and imidazole groups (1).

DSI000258,Taurine,C0039350,"Taurine is a free amino sulfonic acid found in many tissues of mammals. In the bile, it conjugates with cholesterol to form soluble acids to facilitate excretion. Taurine also plays an important role in the functioning of cardiovascular, skeletal muscle, and nervous systems. Meat, seafood, and dairy products are rich sources, but it can also be synthesized in the body from cysteine . Vegetarians may have lower plasma levels of taurine due to reduced intake of meats . Taurine is marketed as a dietary supplement and is also a major ingredient in many energy drinks.In preclinical studies, taurine demonstrated neuroprotective effects , reduced diabetic-induced nephropathy , and improved glycemic control . Chronic taurine administration reversed muscle dysfunction and atrophy and decreased oxidative stress , and maternal taurine ingestion conferred protection against offspring developing adult hypertension .In humans, consumption of taurine-rich foods has been associated with lower cardiovascular risk . Evidence on whether taurine can improve exercise performance are mixed , and although taurine increased skeletal muscle in rodents, these results have not been duplicated in humans .A few studies in overweight or obese patients suggest taurine may reduce triglycerides and improve lipid metabolism , increase adiponectin levels, and decrease inflammation and lipid peroxidation . However, long-term supplementation did not affect insulin response or blood glucose levels in patients with type 2 diabetes . Other studies suggest potential decreases in blood pressure and benefit in older patients with congestive heart failure . It may also help manage muscle cramps in patients with chronic liver disease , prevent delirium following liver transplantation , improve cognitive function in dementia patients , and reduce stroke-like episodes in patients with a rare genetic disorder . Acamprosate, a taurine derivative, improved total abstinence and reduced heavy drinking in adults with alcohol use disorders . Other preliminary data suggest taurine co-administration reduced chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting in acute lymphoblastic leukemia , but more studies are needed.Taurine has been associated with some adverse effects in animal models including increased infection risk , delayed learning and memory , and when coadministered with ethanol, drastic reductions in blood glucose resulting in death . In humans, adverse reactions have been reported from excessive ingestion of energy drinks with taurine and caffeine, and in combination with alcohol .",,"Taurine can be synthesized in the body by cysteine sulfinic acid decarboxylase (1). It circulates in free form and is not incorporated into proteins. Taurine binds with cholesterol to form bile acid and protects the liver from alcohol-induced steatosis and lipid peroxidation (29). With respect to skeletal muscle, taurine facilitates Ca2+ dependent excitation–contraction processes, helps regulate cellular volume, and assists in antioxidant defense from stress responses (16). It also serves as a neurotransmitter (35) and crosses the blood-brain barrier by transporters (36). Taurine reduces glutamate excitotoxicity through regulation of calcium ions and mitochondrial energy metabolism (37). Its anti-apoptotic function is due to its inhibition of glutamate-induced membrane depolarization (38).In animal models, taurine reduced hyperglycemia and dyslipidemia by improving insulin sensitivity and leptin modulation (8). It also protected mitochondria of pancreatic islets from malnourishment damage (30). Renoprotective effects were attributed to decreases in proinflammatory cytokines and renal oxidative stress (31). It also inhibited glucose-induced apoptosis in vascular endothelial cells (32), and advanced glycation end products and fibrotic activity to prevent diabetic nephropathy (7).In humans, taurine protected against atherosclerotic disease by reversing endothelial abnormalities (33), and reduced blood pressure by decreasing the levels of plasma epinephrine (20). It also upregulated hydrogen sulfide-synthesizing enzyme expression and reduced vascular reactivity via inhibition of transient receptor potential channel subtype 3-mediated calcium influx (43).","Meat and seafood, especially dark meat poultry, sardines, and shellfish; dairy products (28)",2-Aminoethanesulfonic acid | L-taurine | Tauric acid,Taurine | L-taurine | 2-Aminoethylsulfonic acid | L-Taurine,carbobenzoxy beta-alanyl-taurine | L-Taurine | Taurine,Taurine,

DSI000261,Royal jelly,C0073603,"Royal jelly is a viscous substance secreted by worker bees and constitutes the essential food for queen bees and their larvae. It is consumed as a health food around the world. Preclinical studies suggest vasodilatory, hypotensive, antihypercholesterolemic, anti-inflammatory, and estrogenic effects , although its affinity for estrogen receptors is weaker compared with diethylstilbestrol . Royal jelly appeared to increase cytotoxic activity of temozolomide , but has also shown both inhibitory and proliferative effects. Animal studies suggest it may be helpful for colitis or to improve testosterone levels . Studies in humans are limited. Some suggest improved total serum lipid and cholesterol levels in those with moderately elevated levels , and improved erythropoiesis and glucose tolerance in healthy subjects . Other data suggest it may improve type 2 diabetes or cardiometabolic markers , but a meta-analysis determined that supplementation does not improve glucose levels , and quality of evidence is generally low . A combination supplement that contained royal jelly appeared to benefit patients with mild cognitive impairment . Other studies suggest that royal jelly supplementation may improve premenstrual and menopausal symptoms. It may also help preserve bone mineral density in postmenopausal women . Only a few studies have been conducted in cancer patients. Royal jelly swished, then swallowed, along with standard mouthwash therapy improved symptoms of oral mucositis and healing time in patients receiving radiotherapy and chemotherapy . Another small study suggests benefit with topical royal jelly ointment in head and neck cancer patients . Because royal jelly has estrogenic effects , women with estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer should avoid this product. Prostate cancer patients should also use caution as royal jelly increased testosterone levels in animal studies .",,"In animal models, anti-inflammatory effects with royal jelly were likely mediated by CD3-, CD5-, CD8- and CD45-positive T-cell immune responses (22). Protective effects against taxol-induced testicular damage were attributed to improved antioxidant status and E2f1 transcription factor upregulation (31).
Various mechanisms for cholesterol-lowering effects have been posited (5). Royal jelly may decrease reabsorption of cholesterol in the GI tract and increase its excretion in the bile due to the presence of phytosterols, mainly B-sitosterol. Another explanation offered is that royal jelly suppresses hepatic cholesterol synthesis (8).
Effects against oxidative stress are attributed to antioxidant peptides (24). Improved glucose tolerance and erythropoiesis occur from accelerated conversion of DHEA-S to testosterone via activation of 3β-HSD2 and/or 17β-HSD3 (32). In type 2 diabetic women, royal jelly supplementation reduced hemoglobin A1c and fasting blood glucose levels, increased insulin concentrations, and decreased oxidative stress via improvement of malondialdehyde levels, erythrocyte superoxide dismutase, and glutathione peroxidase activities (23).
Compounds identified in royal jelly exhibit weak estrogenic activity, but also inhibit binding of estradiol to estrogen receptor beta (4).
Major royal jelly protein 3 was identified as the main allergen that can induce anaphylaxis and cross-reactivity with honeycomb (37).",Apis mellifera - secretion | Apis mellifera - secretion,Bee Saliva | Bee Spit | Honey Bee Milk | Royal Bee Jelly,Royal jelly | Royal Jelly extract,Royal Jelly,Royal Jelly,

DSI000268,Lycopene,C0065331,"A natural pigment synthesized by plants and microorganisms, lycopene is used primarily as an antioxidant and to prevent and treat cancer, heart disease, and macular degeneration. Lycopene is classified as a non-provitamin A carotenoid, with other examples being lutein and zeaxanthin. Alpha-carotene, beta-carotene, and beta-cryptoxanthin are classified as provitamin A carotenoids because they can be converted into retinol. Small clinical trials suggest possible benefit against exercise-induced asthma and benign prostatic hyperplasia . However, no optimal dosage has been established. Data from observational studies indicate an inverse association of lycopene consumption with risk of developing cardiovascular disease , with a randomized study reporting endothelial function improvements in CVD patients but not healthy volunteers . Epidemiologic studies suggest an inverse relationship between lycopene consumption and cancer risk , particularly lung , stomach , prostate , and hormone-positive breast cancers . A consistent association between lycopene consumption and endometrial cancer risk has yet to be reported . Clinical data on lycopene supplementation for prostate cancer prevention remain inconclusive. Whereas low intake of tomato sauce was associated with advanced prostate cancer in patients with low-grade cancer at diagnosis , other studies indicate that lycopene or tomato-based regimens do not prevent prostate cancer , and that circulating carotenoids are not useful dietary intervention targets for prostate cancer prevention . In men with high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia, a lycopene-rich extract did not confer any benefits , and high doses of lycopene, green tea catechins, and selenium were actually associated with higher prostate cancer incidence . Also, variable results were reported for lycopene supplementation in prostate cancer patients . In other studies, increasing lycopene intake altered serum metabolome of men at risk of prostate cancer by affecting reductions in pyruvate, higher levels of which increase the risk of prostate cancer . Intake of a tomato-soy juice resulted in nonsignificant decreases in prostate-specific antigen slope . Lycopene enhanced docetaxel efficacy against prostate cancer in animal models , and preliminary data in patients with metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer also suggest favorable activity with docetaxel plus lycopene . Given these mixed results, more studies are needed to determine whether lycopene has protective effects in prostate cancer. Furthermore, variation in genes related to carotenoid metabolism may also play a role in heterogeneous tissue responses to lycopene . Quality control of lycopene supplements has been an issue of concern. An analysis of six commercially available brands revealed that lycopene content varied from the labeled dosage by as much as 43% .",,"Lycopene is a natural pigment synthesized by plants and microorganisms. Referred to as a nonprovitamin A carotenoid, it is not known to have vitamin A activity. Biological actions include antioxidant activity via singlet oxygen quenching and peroxyl radical scavenging, induction of cell to cell communication, and growth control, although this appears to occur with less efficiency than with beta-carotene (15). Preventive consumption of lycopene attenuated effects of acetaminophen-induced liver injury in a murine model (29).
Proposed mechanisms of cancer-preventive effects include inhibition of cancer growth, induction of differentiation by modulation of cell cycle regulatory proteins, alterations in IGF-1 (16) or VEGF (17) levels, prevention of oxidative DNA damage, and possible enhancement of carcinogen-metabolizing enzymes (18). In human liver adenocarcinoma cells, antimetastatic activity was attributed to downregulation of NADPH oxidase 4, which produces ROS (30).
Other possible mechanisms for all carotenoids include immune enhancement as well as inhibition of mutagenesis and transformation, and premalignant lesions. Carotenoids are also associated with decreased risk for macular degeneration and cataracts, and some types of cancers and cardiovascular events (19).
Potential synergy of lycopene with docetaxel has been proposed to occur via downregulated IGF-I signaling inhibition and decreased survivin (37).","Lycopene extracted from tomato | Solanum lycopersicum - fruit | Solanum lycopersicum - fruit | Tomatoes, tomato products, watermelon, guava, rose hips, and pink grapefruit (15)",Nonprovitamin A carotenoid,"Lycopene | All-trans-lycopene | psi,psi-Carotene",Lycopene,Lycopene,

DSI000277,Protease,C0030940,"Proteolytic enzyme (PE) treatments were first popularized in Germany in the 1960s for inflammation, osteoarthritis, autoimmune diseases, and viral infections. The products usually contain a mixture of pancreatin, papain, bromelain, trypsin, and chymotrypsin. Preclinical studies indicate that PEs have immunomodulatory and tumoricidal properties . Such effects are thought to result from degradation of abnormal immune complexes. In clinical studies, oral administration of PEs to healthy volunteers resulted in immunomodulatory effects . Systemic therapy with PE before and after exhaustive exercise increased maximal concentric strength and had favorable effects on inflammatory, metabolic, and immune biomarkers . In a randomized trial of subjects with moderate-to-severe knee osteoarthritis, oral PE had effectiveness comparable to diclofenac in relieving pain and increasing function . Although some clinical and epidemiological studies suggest benefit with adjuvant PEs in patients with head and neck cancers , multiple myeloma , breast cancer , and cervical cancer , conflicting data do not support the findings . A randomized controlled trial also failed to find sufficient evidence to support use of PEs for preventing mucositis . Further, results from a study involving patients with inoperable pancreatic cancer showed a decrease in overall survival and poorer quality of life with PEs compared with standard gemcitabine-based chemotherapy . Findings from two meta-analyses suggest that PEs may be useful for preventing acute radiation-induced skin reactions , but more studies are needed to confirm such effects.",,"PEs are thought to exert immunomodulatory effects by causing increased release of reactive oxygen species by polymorphonuclear leukocytes (7) or by production of tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukins IL-6 and IL-1B that cause cytotoxic effects (1) (2). The anti-angiogenic effects exhibited by papain in VEGF-activated human endothelial cells are concentration-dependent and likely due to interference with AKT, MEK1/2 and SAPK/JNK phosphorylation (15). Bromelain has been shown to lower the tumorigenic/metastatic capacities of sarcoma L-1 cells (3). It also inhibited glioma cell migration and invasion by affecting expression of integrins, necessary for cellular migration and invasion (5).

DSI000282,Moringa oleifera,C0949952,"Moringa oleifera (MO) is an edible plant native to Asia and Africa that is also cultivated around the world. The leaves and seed pods are nutritious and widely consumed as food while the bark and root are used in folk remedies for their perceived medicinal properties. Products derived from this botanical are used to treat a variety of conditions including asthma, diabetes, ulcers, infections, and cancer. In addition, the plant extracts are used in primitive water filtration systems to remove pollutants and algae . Preclinical studies suggest various properties with MO leaf, seed, and root extracts, including anticancer , hepatoprotective , hypoglycemic , anti-inflammatory , antibacterial , antifungal , antiviral , and antisickling effects. Models suggest potential to protect against Alzheimer’s disease and digestive ulcers , promote wound healing , and lower cholesterol levels . Studies in humans are quite limited. Preliminary findings suggest MO exerts a small positive effect on lipid profiles . An MO leaf powder increased insulin secretion in healthy subjects , and improved nutritional status and intake of AIDS patients undergoing antiretroviral therapy . Systematic reviews determined potential benefits of MO in cardiovascular or metabolic disorders and also cite the need for well-designed studies in diabetic or prediabetic patients .",,"Moringa is a nutritionally rich botanical with a high polyphenol content, including phenolic acids, flavonoids, and glucosinolates (48). In preclinical studies, fiber content of MO leaves mediated quercetin-3-glucoside to improve glucose tolerance (7) (12). Phenolic glycosides from the fruit show anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting nitric oxide (13). Dipeptide and urea derivatives from MO roots also have anti-inflammatory and antinociceptive effects (14). The ethanolic seed extract produced immunosuppressive and anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting leukocytes and splenocytes (15) as well as histamine release from mast cells (16).
In an animal model, MO root extract demonstrated protective effects on the liver and kidney in a dose-dependent manner (22). Hepatoprotective effects from acetaminophen toxicity may occur by maintaining glutathione levels (11). MO extract may protect against stomach ulcers by modulating 5-HT3 receptors (24) and lower cholesterol by inhibiting HMG-CoA reductase (25).
Lab experiments suggest an array of other properties in this botanical. A leaf extract exhibited protective effects against Alzheimer’s disease by modulating brain monoamines (29). It also may help promote wound healing by increasing collagen deposits (30). Anticancer effects may occur via apoptosis (3) (4) and NF-kappaB inhibition (5) (46). In an animal model, an MO extract helped prevent chemically-induced tumor formation by increasing glutathione activity (6).
A moringa water extract showed hormone-modulating properties, stimulation of uterine and cervical epithelium metaplasia (26) (27), and antifertility effects (28). In a murine model, MO was genotoxic at supra-supplementation levels of 3,000 mg/kg body weight (39). In a case report of Stevens-Johnson Syndrome linked to ingestion of moringa, pathogenesis may be related to an immunomodulatory effect such as a delayed Th1-mediated hypersensitivity reaction (49).",Leaf | Moringa leaves are eaten in many parts of the tropics where the trees are found.,Horseradish tree | Drumstick tree | Benzolive tree | Ben oil tree,Moringa oleifera,,Moringa oleifera,

The seeds, commonly known as black seeds or black cumin, are used in cooking and in traditional medicine to reduce inflammation, as well as to treat infections and cancer.Constituents from N. sativa demonstrated immunomodulatory , antioxidant , antiparasitic and hepatoprotective effects in preclinical studies. Small clinical trials suggest benefits of seed extracts for the treatment of asthma , allergic diseases , rheumatoid arthritis , dyspepsia , H. pylori infection , diabetes , and for ameliorating hepatic steatosis and insulin resistance in patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease . Data on anti-hypertensive effects are conflicting . Thymoquinone, a major constituent, conferred antiepileptic effects in children with refractory seizures . Topical use of N. sativa oil reduced cyclical mastalgia , improved urinary incontinence in menopausal women , and both topical and oral use relieved osteoarthritic knee pain, but oral intake of N. sativa seed powder did not have similar benefit . Oral oil use improved metabolic parameters in patients with coronary artery disease and had cardiovascular protective effects in patients with type-2 diabetes .Thymoquinone and other constituents also showed anticancer effects . N. sativa oil, when injected, protected against radiation-induced tissue damage in a murine model . Oral intake of N. sativa seeds lowered the incidence of febrile neutropenia and length of hospital stay in children with brain tumors ; and topical application of an N. sativa gel decreased the severity of acute radiation dermatitis in breast cancer patients . Larger studies are needed to confirm these findings.",,"Thymoquinone, one of the chief constituents of N. sativa oil has antioxidant effects and restored the levels of lactate dehydrogenase, glutathione, and SOD in animal models (6) (7) (9). This may also explain its hepatoprotective effects (3) (4). Studies have also shown that N. sativa oil exerts anti-inflammatory properties by inhibiting cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase (18). Nigellone, a constituent of the crude seed extract, inhibited histamine release from rat peritoneal mast cells (10) and may reduce allergy symptoms in humans (12). N. sativa also decreased hypertension in rats likely via its diuretic effects (5), and decreased uterine smooth muscle contractions (14).The antioxidant effects of nigella are thought to protect tissues from radiation injury (15). However, it is not clear if this would also make radiation therapy less effective. Possible antitumor mechanisms of thymoquinone include inhibition of DNA synthesis (7), and promotion of apoptosis by inhibiting cell growth in G1 phase (8).

DSI000321,Pollen,C0032385,"Pollen extract is an ingredient in a standardized Swedish natural product that contains both pollen and pistils derived from members of the Poaceae family of grasses. It has been used as an herbal remedy to relieve premenstrual, perimenopausal, and menopausal symptoms such as fatigue, hot flashes, irritability, and sleeplessness. Although the exact mechanism of action remains unclear, preclinical studies did not find estrogenic activity , suggesting it does not work by modulating hormones. This is of particular interest among patients with hormone-sensitive cancers who have limited options and may have safety concerns with more conventional methods to address such symptoms. Initial open-label studies suggested that a standardized pollen extract was useful in alleviating premenstrual, perimenopausal, and menopausal symptoms , although one of these studies combined the extract with royal jelly . In a follow-up randomized controlled trial, pollen extract reduced hot flashes and improve quality of life in menopausal women . A double-blind RCT found a reduction in premenstrual sleep disturbances, which was more pronounced in women who identified irritability as their main symptom . No studies have been conducted in cancer populations. Therefore, additional clinical trials are needed to confirm safety and efficacy of pollen extract, including for use among cancer patients. Pollen extract should not be confused with propolis, which is pollen harvested by bees from many different plant families, and may also include other substances such as beeswax.",,"There are two active ingredients in the formulation studied: a combined pollen and pistil extract (PI 82, 75%), which contains high levels of superoxide dismutase, and a pure pollen extract (GC FEM, 25%) (4). PI 82 pollen extracts are derived from Secale cereale (rye grass), Dactylis glomerata (orchard grass), and Pinus silvestris (Scots pine) while the pollen-pistil extract is derived from Zea mays. GC FEM pollen extract is derived from S. cereale, Z. mays, and P. silvestris  (1). The preparation is standardized to contain 14 mg of amino acids per tablet (4).
Laboratory studies determined that the pollen extract preparation used in studies contained low concentrations of the phytoestrogens daidzin, daidzein, and genistin, that were considered to be subeffective. These studies also did not detect genistein, formononetin, or biochanin A (1). In vitro, purified Swedish pollen extract did not show inhibition of CYP2D6 enzymes (6). Animal studies suggest that high doses of pollen extract do not cause uterine growth in immature female rats, suggesting no estrogenic effects (1).
The exact mechanism for reduction of menopausal symptoms remains unclear but one study suggests that the antioxidant properties of the ingredients may play a role (4).",Phleum pratense- Anther | Pollen (members of the grass (Poaceae) family including rye (Secale cereale)) | Bee pollen,Swedish pollen extract | Swedish flower pollen | Flower pollen extract | Purified pollen extract,Pollen Extract | Pollen-pistil extract | Pollen,Pollen | Pine Pollen | Pollen (unspecified),Pollen Extract,

DSI000325,Ligustrum lucidum,C1258043,"Ligustrum lucidum is a medicinal plant that is often used in combination with other herbs in traditional Chinese medicine. There are several species of Ligustrum that are thought to have different medicinal properties . Traditionally, the plant is used to treat diminished eyesight, dizziness, fever, and insomnia. Some herbalists also use it to treat side effects caused by chemotherapy and to increase immune function in cancer patients. In vitro studies suggest that the fruits of Ligustrum lucidum have antitumor , immunomodulatory , antidiabetic , antiosteoporotic , antiviral , antimutagenic , hepatoprotective , and cytotoxic effects . In animal models, Ligustrum compounds showed antiosteoporotic and vision-sparing effects. Ligustrum combined with Siberian ginseng may have protective effects against chemotherapy-induced myelosuppression . Data in humans are quite limited. In a small study of non-small cell lung cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy, a formula containing reishi mushroom and Ligustrum was found to help maintain quality of life .",,"In vitro studies suggest antitumor effects occur via immunomodulation and by reverting macrophage suppression brought about by tumors (4), or are due to increases in phagocytes and lymphokine-activated killer cells (5). Ligustrum may induce apoptosis in human hepatocellular carcinoma cells via p21 upregulation (17). Hepatoprotective effects are due to oleanolic acid and perhaps mediated by an increase in hepatic glutathione regeneration capacity (11).
Secoiridoid glucosides showed antioxidant effects against free radical-associated hemolysis of erythrocytes (1). The secoiridoid glucoside oleuropein has demonstrated antiviral activity against respiratory syncytial virus and parainfluenza type 3 virus (8) while other secoiridoid compounds showed activity against influenza A virus (16). The compound specnuezhenide may confer vision improvement effects via inhibition of HIF-1alpha/VEGF signaling pathway (20).
Salidroside and nuzhenide have been identified as potential antiosteoporotic compounds (15). In a murine model of diabetes-induced osteoporosis, ligustroflavone from Ligustrum fruit appeared to have protective effects via regulation of parathyroid hormone levels and improved calcium balance by acting on calcium-sensing receptors (19).",Ligustrum lucidum - Fruit,Privet | Nu zhen zi | Glossy privet | Dong qing zin,Ligustrum lucidum,,Ligustrum lucidum,

DSI000364,Stem bromelain,C0293742,"Bromelain is a proteolytic enzyme obtained from pineapple stems that has a range of applications. Preclinical data suggest it has anti-inflammatory properties , reduces serum fibrinogen levels, supports fibrinolysis, and has debriding effects on burn wounds .Clinical findings reported safety and effectiveness of a bromelain-based product for burn and chronic wound debridement although a case series suggests it may not be useful for diabetic foot burns . Other small studies suggest benefit for treating specific skin conditions , improving acute knee pain , and for alleviating postoperative pain, swelling and bleeding . However, data on whether it can reduce inflammation or relieve arthritis pain are mixed , and it does not appear to reduce fibrinogen or influence other cardiovascular disease risk factors .Bromelain demonstrated chemopreventive and antitumorigenic effects in preclinical studies. A formulation of alpha-Lipoic acid, Boswellia serrata, methylsulfonylmethane and bromelain improved symptoms of aromatase inhibitor-associated arthralgia in early breast cancer postmenopausal patients . A case report of prostate cancer patients found adjunctive use of bromelain with immunotherapy reduced PSA levels and stabilized the disease . Well-designed randomized trials are needed to evaluate the anticancer potential of bromelain.",,"Proteolytic removal of cell surface molecules by bromelain may account for some of its activities. Preclinical studies suggest it prevents platelet aggregation and adhesion to blood vessel endothelial cells (13). Anti-inflammatory effects are attributed to reduced levels of prostaglandin E2 and thromboxane A2 (9). In addition, bromelain inhibits neutrophil migration in response to IL-8 during inflammation (14) and decreases pro-inflammatory chemokine and cytokine secretion (15) (16).Oral enzymes such as bromelain have been proposed as additive agents for cancer therapy (8). Proposed mechanisms include downregulation of the immunosuppressive cytokine TGF-beta (7), direct inhibition of tumor cell growth, modulation of immune cell function and cell adhesion molecules, and the effects on platelet aggregation and thrombosis mentioned above (8) (9). Experiments with murine models suggest bromelain induces apoptosis-related proteins and inhibits NF-kappaB-driven Cox-2 expression by blocking MAPK and Akt/protein kinase B signaling (20). Bromelain also induced expression of autophagy-related proteins, light chain 3 protein B II, and beclin-1, thereby facilitating apoptosis in mammary carcinoma cells (26).",Ananas comosus var. comosus - Stem | Ananas comosus var. comosus - fruit | Ananas comosus var. comosus - fruit | Fruit(s) | Pineapple,"

DSI000389,(E)-8-Methyl-N-vanillyl-6-nonenamide,C0006931,"Capsaicin is the active component derived from the fruit of capsicum or cayenne pepper. It has been used in traditional medical systems as a remedy to relieve muscle and arthritic pain, and to treat cluster headaches and psoriasis. For these purposes, capsaicin is an active ingredient in some topical creams and nasal sprays. It is also available in a prescription-strength patch. Oral formulations are marketed largely for digestive and circulatory problems, poor appetite, and weight loss. (See Cayenne Pepper) Studies support benefits of topical low-concentration capsaicin formulations for psoriasis , prurigo nodularis , pruritus ani , and uremic pruritis . It is also conditionally recommended for osteoarthritis , and a meta-analysis suggests it may be as effective as topical NSAIDs for osteoarthritic pain , but its utility for rheumatoid arthritis remains inconclusive . An older clinical trial shows capsaicin 0.075% cream may control post-surgical pain in cancer patients . A case report in a palliative care patient using capsaicin 0.025% for opioid-refractory upper extremity pain also reported benefit . A high-concentration dermal capsaicin patch was shown safe and effective for postherpetic neuralgia , and was approved for prescription use. Data also suggest it is superior to pregabalin , and effective for diabetic and non-diabetic peripheral neuropathy, heterogenous neuropathic pain , and neuropathic pain arising from radiculopathies , but not HIV-associated neuropathic pain . A recent systematic review cites some benefit for both postherpetic neuralgia and HIV-neuropathy over controls. However, the patch is best used when other therapies have failed due to the small number of patients who may benefit (1 in 8) and unknown risks . Low-concentration capsaicin was determined as unlikely to have meaningful use for these conditions in clinical practice . Data are also limited in patients with post-mastectomy neuropathy . Preliminary findings suggest improvements in swallowing function in elderly patients with dysphagia with application of 0.025% capsaicin ointment to the external auditory canal . Topical capsaicin can also be effective for cannabis-associated hyperemesis . Only a few small studies suggest intranasal capsaicin of divergent formulations may be helpful for rhinitis , and its effectiveness for cluster headaches is unknown . There is continued controversy over whether capsaicin acts as a carcinogen, co-carcinogen, or anti-carcinogen . For example, capsaicin has demonstrated chemopreventive and antiproliferative effects against various cell lines including breast , bladder , prostate cancer cells . Also, a small study suggests utility of a high-concentration dermal capsaicin patch in relieving pain associated with chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) . However, long-term topical application was shown to increase skin carcinogenesis in mice treated with a tumor promoter , although such effects may be concentration-dependent . Therefore, more studies are needed to clarify the roles of capsaicin in relationship to cancer.",,"The analgesic effect of capsaicin is multifactorial. It depolarizes C-fiber polymodal nociceptors (23) (24). This causes the release of substance P, the neurotransmitter that relays pain signals to the brain (25), which causes an initial increase in pain. With repeated application, pain subsides due to the eventual depletion of substance P at the afferent neurons (26). Capsaicin also activates transient receptor potential vanilloid subfamily member 1 (TRPV1, also known as the capsaicin receptor) (27), causing selective and reversible defunctionalization of cutaneous sensory nerve endings expressing TRPV1 (28).
Improved swallowing function in elderly dysphagic patients, particularly glottal closure and cough reflex, was attributed to TRPV1-mediated aural stimulation of vagal Arnold’s nerve with capsaicin ointment (43). 
Studies on various cancer cell lines have shown that capsaicin demonstrates chemopreventive properties by causing cell-cycle arrest and inducing apoptosis, or by generating reactive oxygen species (ROS) and depolarizing mitochondrial membranes, and through caspase activation (17) (19) (20). Alternatively, the co-carcinogenic effect of capsaicin on chemically-induced skin carcinogenesis is mediated through the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), but not TRPV1 (18). Further exploration of caspaicin-induced apoptosis, in glioma cells, found inhibition of autophagy to be a likely contributor (34). Interestingly, capsaicin was also shown to induce autophagy by enhancing the levels of autophagy markers LC3-II and Atg5, increasing p62 and Fap-1 degradation and increasing caspase-3 activity to induce apoptosis in human nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells (41).","Capsaicin | Cayenne peppers, hot sauces containing chili peppers",Capsaicin (topical formulations),(E)-8-Methyl-N-vanillyl-6-nonenamide | (6E)-N-[(4-Hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl)methyl]-8-methyl-6-nonenamide | Capsaicin,Capsaicin,Capsaicin,

DSI000448,Shark Cartilage,C0281563,"Obtained from the spiny dogfish shark and hammerhead shark , shark cartilage is promoted as a dietary supplement to treat cancer , arthritis, osteoporosis, Kaposi sarcoma , macular degeneration, psoriasis , and inflammatory disorders. Shark cartilage extracts showed antiangiogenic and antitumor activities in vitro and in animal models , but clinical use remains controversial due to lack of bioavailability data and unsatisfactory patient outcomes in clinical trials . Shark cartilage has also been studied for Kaposi sarcoma , metastatic renal cell carcinoma , and multiple myeloma in early phase clinical trials. Neovastat (AE-941), a purified shark cartilage extract, did not improve survival in patients with non-small cell lung cancer , but is effective against psoriasis . Most trials report low toxicity, but regular consumption of a shark cartilage supplement was associated with reversible hepatic dysfunction in a 57-year-old man . The Federal Trade Commission has barred manufacturers from making unsubstantiated claims of efficacy for their shark cartilage products . Shark cartilage should not be confused with bovine cartilage.",,"The glycoproteins sphyrnastatin 1 and 2 and other unidentified factors (1) are thought responsible for the activity of shark cartilage (SC), which shows strong antiangiogenic activity and inhibition of tumor neovascularization in numerous in vitro and animal studies (17). Theories for its mechanism include interference with endothelial cell migration and adhesion via modification of adhesion protein organization and inhibition of collagenase (18).
A murine glioma model suggests that induction of t-PA plays an essential role (19). Intraperitoneal administration suppresses sarcoma-180 growth and B16-F10 melanoma metastasis in mice (9) (11), but oral bioavailability is questionable based on the results of mouse models (20). The manufacturers of Neovastat (AE-941), a shark cartilage extract, report that this formulation inhibits embryonic vascularization  (21), endothelial cell proliferation (22), tubulogenesis, VEGF binding to endothelial cells, VEGF-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of the VEGF receptor, and the VEGF-dependent increase in vascular permeability in vitro. They also claim that it inhibits serine elastase and matrix metalloproteinase activity (23). Oral administration of Neovastat has produced anti-tumor effects in mouse models (10).
A diet containing the acidic ethanol-precipitate-fraction of a water extract of shark cartilage significantly increased serum inhibitory activity against matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 and reduced the number of adenocarcinomas in the pancreatic duct in a hamster model (24).",Shark cartilage | Shark cartilage,Shark Cartilage,Shark Cartilage | Shark cartilage,Shark Cartilage,Shark Cartilage,

A small clinical study showed that a formulation containing slippery elm improved the bowel habits and symptoms of constipation-predominant irritable bowel syndrome . Slippery elm is one of the components in Essiac, an herbal formula used as an alternative cancer treatment.",,"Mucilage in slippery elm is responsible for its demulcent, emollient, and antitussive properties. Insoluble polysaccharides in mucilage (hexose, pentose, methylpentose) form a viscous material following oral administration or when prepared for topical use. The fiber content is thought to reduce gastrointestinal transit time, act as a bulk forming laxative, and adsorb toxins. Mucosal biopsies from patients with active ulcerative colitis incubated with slippery elm showed a dose-dependent reduction in oxygen free radicals (4). Another in vitro study also showed antioxidant scavenging activity (5). The tannin component can act as an astringent (2).

DSI000501,versicolorin,C0950217,"Coriolus versicolor is a mushroom of the Basidiomycetes class. It is used in traditional Chinese medicine as a tonic, and studies suggest that it has immunostimulant and antitumor properties. Polysaccharide-K (PSK), a proprietary product derived from Coriolus, was developed for cancer treatment in Japan. Other Coriolus extracts such as polysaccharide-peptide (PSP) and VPS are available as dietary supplements. When used as an adjuvant, PSK appears to improve survival rates in patients with gastric and colorectal cancers. It may also benefit patients with esophageal cancer . Findings from a study of PSP in conjunction with chemotherapy suggest benefits in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer . PSP was also reported to act as a prebiotic and to modulate human intestinal microbiome composition . Studies of Coriolus extracts alone or in combination with other botanicals suggest positive immunomodulatory effects . However, data on their effects on breast cancer , hepatocellular carcinoma , or leukemia are mixed. A meta-analysis reported reduced mortality risk with adjuvant use of Coriolus across a variety of cancers , but confirmatory studies are needed. In an open-label randomized trial, use of a Coriolus–based vaginal gel had clinical benefit over watchful waiting for patients with HPV-related low-grade cervical lesions . Coriolus extracts are generally well tolerated but minor adverse effects have been reported. Many over-the-counter products are not standardized, making it difficult to compare potency between brands. It is also unclear if PSK, PSP, and other Coriolus extracts have comparable effects.",,"Coriolus versicolor is thought to be a biological response modifier. In vitro, PSP, PSK, and Coriolus extract induces apoptosis in leukemia cells (13) (23) (24). PSP also increased apoptosis in cells treated with camptothecin, reduced proliferation, progression, and 3H-thymidine uptake, and prolonged DNA synthesis time (14). A Coriolus medicinal mushroom blend inhibited cell proliferation and induced G2/M cell cycle arrest in an invasive breast cancer cell line (15). The mushroom extract inhibits expression of cell-cycle regulatory genes and suppresses metastatic behavior via inhibition of cell adhesion, migration, and invasion. Antiproliferative effects were linked to suppression of urokinase plasminogen activator (15). PSP also inhibits interaction between HIV-1 gp120 and CD4 receptor, HIV-1 transcriptase activity, and glycohydrolase enzyme activity associated with viral glycosylation (16).
Several animal studies report synergy between PSK and biologic therapies, including a concanavalin A-bound L1210 vaccine and the IgG2a monoclonal antibody against human colon cancer cells (17). PSP induces cytokine production and T-cell proliferation, and prevents cyclophosphamide-induced immune suppression. Peritoneal macrophages isolated from PSP-fed mice show increased production of reactive nitrogen intermediates, superoxide anions, and TNF (18). PSP also shows analgesic activity in mouse models (19).
In human studies, non-small cell lung cancer patients have increased leukocyte and neutrophil counts after PSP consumption, as well as increased serum IgG and IgM (6). Healthy volunteers and breast cancer patients who used a formula containing Coriolus and Salvia had elevated CD4+ counts, a high CD4+/CD8+ ratio, and elevated absolute counts of B-lymphocytes (7) (8). TNF-alpha and IL-8 gene expression were significantly induced after PSK administration in healthy volunteers and gastric cancer patients, although individual response varied (20).
High doses of a hot water extract of Coriolus enhanced development of large intestinal tumors in mice (12). However, this is not clinically relevant as the dosage was 10-13x higher than what is used in human studies and the mice were injected with known potent carcinogens.",Trametes versicolor - Fruiting body,PSK | PSP | VPS | Turkey Tail | Yun Zhi | Kawaratake | Krestin,Trametes versicolor,,Coriolus versicolor,

DSI000550,"1,2-Dithiolane-3-pentanoic acid",C0023791,"Alpha lipoic acid (ALA) is an endogenous cofactor found in cells. It can be obtained from a variety of foods in the diet. ALA is sometimes referred to as a “universal antioxidant” because it is both water- and fat-soluble and can neutralize free radicals . It is marketed as a dietary supplement for this reason, and is also used as adjuvant therapy for neuropathy and to improve glycemic control. Preclinical studies show that ALA plays a crucial role in energy production, and exerts antioxidant and apoptotic effects . Studies on ALA in humans have been conducted across various populations. Preliminary data suggest long-term supplementation may help preserve walking ability in patients with secondary progressive multiple sclerosis, especially those with less disability at baseline . Studies of intravenous and oral forms suggest improved insulin sensitivity, vasodilation, and neuropathy symptoms in diabetic patients , although earlier studies to determine its role in reversing neuropathies and liver disease produced mixed results. Data from a double-blind RCT suggest short-term ALA supplementation can be beneficial for idiopathic pain without altering glycemia in patients with normal levels , but another trial did not find it helpful for fibromyalgia . In women with gestational diabetes, oral ALA may improve liver function and glucose metabolism . Meta-analyses also suggest ALA supplementation may reduce inflammatory mediators such as CRP, IL-6, TNF-α, and improve some glucose and lipid parameters , but confirming studies are needed. In other preliminary studies, ALA induced mild weight loss and waist circumference reduction in overweight or obese subjects . Long-term use of R-ALA, which has increased bioavailability, produced modest weight loss in overweight/obese adults without significant reductions in triglyceride levels . In postoperative settings, ALA helped improve wound healing and scarring in women undergoing cesarean section , and reduced pain after carpal tunnel decompression . In patients with atrial fibrillation, it reduced serum markers of inflammation but not AF recurrence after ablative treatment . Although current data suggest protective effects of antioxidants against Alzheimer’s disease, such effects were not found with a combination of coenzyme Q, vitamin C, vitamin E, and ALA . And even though preclinical studies of ALA demonstrate antioxidant properties with efficacy in neurodegenerative models, oral ALA was ineffective in patients with geographic atrophy from advanced macular degeneration . High doses of ALA can cause hypoglycemic symptoms and other serious conditions. ALA may also antagonize the effects of chemotherapy and radiation therapy because of its antioxidant properties.",,"ALA acts as a lipophilic free radical scavenger. Dihydrolipoic acid (DHLA), a reduced form of ALA, has more antioxidant effects. It can assist in repairing oxidative damage and regenerate endogenous antioxidants such as vitamin C, vitamin E, and glutathione. Both DHLA and ALA also have metal-chelating capacities. As a lipoamide, ALA functions as a cofactor in various multienzyme systems involved in the decarboxylation of alpha-keto acids such as pyruvate (13) (14) (15).
ALA produced cell cycle arrest in G0/G1 phases in FaDu and Jurkat human tumor cell lines (1). It also scavenged ROS in MCF-7 breast cancer cells, followed by cell growth arrest and apoptosis (16). In another study, ALA induced cell death in colorectal cancer cells independent of their p53 status, and enhanced cytotoxicity of 5-fluorouracil (22).
In healthy controls and secondary progressive multiple sclerosis patients, ALA appears to stimulate cAMP production (36). In critically ill patients, ALA reduced oxidative stress and improved insulin resistance (37).","R-alpha-Lipoic acid | Adipic acid | Lipoic acid | DL-alpha-Lipoic acid | DL-alpha-Lipoic acid | Organ meats, spinach, broccoli, tomato, peas, Brussels sprouts, rice bran",Thioctic acid | Lipoate | Lipoic acid | ALA | Thioctan,"1,2-dithiolane-3-pentanoic acid | 1,2-Dithiolane-3-pentanoic acid, (R) | Alpha lipoic acid | 1,2-dithiolane-3-pentanoic acid, (R) | (+-)-1,2-Dithiolane-3-pentanoic acid | Thioctic Acid | Lipoic acid | (±)-1,2-Dithiolane-3-pentanoic acid | 1,2-dithiolane-3-valeric acid | (+)-1,2-dithiolane-3-pentanoic acid | R-a-lipoic acid | Thioctic acid | (R)-1,2-dithiolane-3-pentanoic acid | Thioctic acid dl-form | Alpha Lipoic Acid | R-alpha-lipoic acid",Alpha-Lipoic Acid | Alpha Lipoic Acid | Lipoic Acid | Zinc lipoic acid,Alpha-Lipoic Acid,

DSI000553,Ubiquinone,C0041536,"Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10), also known as ubiquinone, is involved in cellular respiration and energy production. It is found in all human cells, with higher concentrations found in the liver, kidney, heart, and pancreas. It is also consumed as a dietary supplement for its antioxidant effects and is often promoted as a preventive agent for cardiovascular diseases, Parkinson’s disease, infertility, and cancer. Studies using murine models suggest antioxidant and neuroprotective effects , and the potential to alleviate radiation-induced nephropathy .Data from some human studies suggest CoQ10 may benefit patients with coronary artery disease and congestive heart failure , and reduce risk of cardiovascular mortality . Other studies using a combination of selenium and CoQ10 also suggest improved cardiac function and reduced mortality risk . However, a systematic review concluded that current evidence does not support routine CoQ10 supplementation in patients with coronary heart disease . According to the American Heart Association, large-scale randomized trials are needed to definitively determine the value of supplementation in managing heart failure .Observations that patients on statins have decreased CoQ10 concentrations in muscle cells resulted in efforts to evaluate CoQ10 for statin-induced myalgias, but data are inconclusive . Short-term CoQ10 supplementation in diabetic hemodialysis patients improved markers of insulin metabolism, but not fasting glucose, HbA1c, or lipid profiles . Supplementation may also reduce pain in those with diabetic neuropathy . A meta-analysis concluded that evidence of benefit in diabetic kidney disease is limited and additional study is needed . Also, supplementation did not improve work efficiency in patients with chronic kidney disease .CoQ10 may be helpful in some cases for migraine prevention . A small study found reduced migraine frequency following supplementation , and other data suggest it may reduce number of migraine days and duration, but not number of attacks or severity . A randomized trial of add-on supplementation in pediatric migraine failed to find benefit .Although neuroprotective effects have been reported in small trials , larger well-designed trials have not shown benefit with CoQ10 supplementation in Parkinson’s or Huntington’s disease . In other studies, adjuvant CoQ10 improved depressive symptoms in patients with bipolar disorder , but an antioxidant mixture including CoQ10, vitamins C and E, and alpha-lipoic acid was ineffective against Alzheimer’s disease .Some data suggest CoQ10 supplementation may increase sperm motility in men , modulate expression of insulin, lipid, and inflammatory markers in women with polycystic ovary syndrome , and reduce fatigue . It may also help reduce reduce some measures of oxidative stress , and inflammatory markers in general population and in patients with chronic diseases . In patients with sepsis, supplementation in the early phase improved clinical parameters and mitochondrial dysfunction .CoQ10 has also been investigated in cancer patients. Preliminary studies on whether it can help control cancer-related fatigue are mixed . In patients on tamoxifen therapy, CoQ10 appeared to lower inflammatory cytokine levels . CoQ10 levels have been positively associated with antioxidant capacity and negatively correlated with inflammation markers post-surgery in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma . However, antioxidant supplementation including CoQ10 before and during treatment was associated with an increased hazard of recurrence in breast cancer patients . More research is needed .CoQ10 may interfere with the actions of warfarin . Because of its antioxidant properties, it may also reduce effectiveness of chemotherapy and radiation therapy .",,"CoQ10 is known to have antioxidant and membrane-stabilizing properties and is the only endogenously produced lipid with a redox function in mammals. All cells are capable of synthesizing CoQ10 and no redistribution between organs occurs through the blood. It is necessary for adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production, and its role as a mobile electron carrier in the mitochondrial electron-transfer processes of respiration and coupled phosphorylation is well established. It also has a direct regulatory role on succinyl and NADH dehydrogenases (1). CoQ10 scavenges free radicals produced by lipid peroxidation and prevents mitochondrial deformity during ischemic episodes, and may help maintain integrity of myocardial calcium ion channels during ischemic insults (2). CoQ10 may also stabilize cellular membranes and prevent depletion of metabolites required for ATP resynthesis (10), and suppress age-related inflammatory reactions and osteoclast differentiation by inhibiting oxidative stress (30). One of the mechanisms underlying the neuroprotective effects of CoQ10 involves inhibition of microglia in pentylenetetrazol-induced kindling epilepsy in mice (40).Other preclinical studies suggest CoQ10 can prevent reduced glucose transporter-4 protein levels in adipocytes caused by simvastatin, which may contribute to the risk of new-onset diabetes in patients on statins (31). It also reduced high glucose-induced apoptosis and dysfunction of endothelial progenitor cells by upregulating endothelial nitric oxide synthase and heme oxygenase via the AMP-activated protein kinase pathway (41). In a murine model, it protected against doxorubicin-induced testicular toxicity by ameliorating oxidative stress, reducing apoptosis, and upregulating testicular P-glycoprotein (32).",Yeast fermentation process | Bacteria,Ubiquinone | Ubidecarenone | Ubiquinol | CoQ | CoQ10,"Ubiquinone | Coenzyme Q10 | Microorganismes CoQ10 - Cellule entière pour biosynthèse  | Ubidecarenone | Coenzyme Q10, ubidecarenone",Coenzyme Q-10 | Coenzyme Q10 | CoQ10,Coenzyme Q10,

DSI000569,Flaxseed,C0023753,"Flaxseed, rich in omega-3 fatty acids and phytoestrogenic lignans, is used in traditional medicine to treat coughs, colds, constipation, urinary tract infections, and as a topical demulcent and an emollient. In clinical studies, flaxseed improved mild menopausal symptoms ; and exerted chemoprotective effects along with affecting moderate reductions in estrogens and androgens in postmenopausal women. It may also benefit women with polycystic ovarian syndrome by reducing androgen levels ; and flaxseed powder combined with Vitex agnus may help reduce cyclical mastalgia . Supplementation with a major lignan derived from flaxseed improved glycemic control in Type-2 diabetic patients . But it was ineffective in reducing hot flashes in postmenopausal women with or without breast cancer . In other studies, flaxseed products were found to reduce blood pressure but did not improve insulin resistance or glycemic indices in pre-diabetic patients although conflicting data suggest otherwise . Supplementation along with lifestyle modification was more effective than lifestyle modification alone to manage metabolic syndrome and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease . Systematic reviews determined that flaxseed may have a role in decreasing appetite and hunger and in preventing cardiovascular events by inhibiting platelet aggregation . It was also found more effective than lactulose and psyllium for improving symptoms of constipation . In patients with ulcerative colitis, both flaxseed and flaxseed oil may affect reductions in systemic inflammation as well as disease severity . In addition, daily flaxseed oil consumption significantly decreased inflammatory markers related to cardiovascular disease , and may help reduce bone resorption in hemodialysis patients. Flaxseed was also shown to confer renoprotection in patients with lupus nephritis ; and may benefit patients with rheumatoid arthritis . Although flaxseed-derived lignan reduced blood glucose levels in hypercholesterolemic individuals , data on its cholesterol-lowering effects are mixed . Preclinical studies suggest that flaxseed may inhibit growth and metastasis of human breast , prostate cancers and melanoma ; and reduce radiation therapy-induced lung damage and improve survival . It was also shown to lower tumor biomarkers in patients with prostate and breast cancer ; and may confer protection against radiation-induced adverse effects in lung cancer patients although such effects could not be accurately determined due to poor tolerability of flaxseed . In other studies, a flaxseed extract was ineffective in preventing oral infection following radiation treatment in head and neck cancer patients ; and supplementation with secoisolariciresinol diglucoside, a lignan, was not superior to placebo in reducing proliferation in benign breast tissue of premenopausal women at increased risk of breast cancer . Flaxseed ingestion can increase urinary lignan excretion and the length of luteal phase of the menstrual cycle . Because flaxseed has phytoestrogenic effects, patients with estrogen receptor positive (ER+) breast cancer should consult their physicians before using it.",,"Flaxseed is the most concentrated food source of the plant lignan, secoisolariciresinol, a precursor for enterolactone. It is thought that phytoestrogenic lignans contribute to the plant’s hormonal effects (4). Flaxseed has been shown to affect the length of the menstrual cycle in premenopausal women (5). It may also alter estrogen metabolism, increasing the ratio of 2-hydroxyestrogen to 16 alpha-hydroxyestrone in a dose-dependent fashion (2). The renoprotective effects of flaxseed are thought to be due to high concentration of alpha-linolenic acid, an omega-3 fatty acid precursor (3) or through inhibition of angiogenesis, tyrosine protein kinases, and cytokine-induced activation of transcription factors (16). The laxative effects of flaxseed are likely due to its fiber content (22).
Animal studies suggest inhibition of growth and metastasis of established human breast cancer with flaxseed is due in part to downregulation of insulin-like growth factor I and expression of the epidermal growth factor receptor (6). Flaxseed also induced apoptosis by significantly upregulating p53 mRNA in breast cancer cell lines (29). In another study, flaxseed oil enhanced effects of trastuzumab in reducing HER2 signaling via Akt and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways, resulting in reduced cell proliferation and increased apoptosis (33). Inhibition of cell proliferation with flaxseed was also reported in models of prostate cancer (7).
In human studies, dietary flaxseed reduced central aortic blood pressure through changes in plasma oxylipins (40) (41). Other studies suggest hormonal effects may play a role in the ability of flaxseed to modulate prostate cancer biology and associated biomarkers (9), and lower serum lipid levels in postmenopausal breast cancer (10).",Linum usitatissimum - Seed | Milled seed,Flax | Linseed | Lint bells | Linum,Flaxseed Protein | Flaxseed,Flaxseed Fiber | Flaxseed | Flaxseed Protein,Flaxseed,

Various formulations using different species have been marketed, vary in amounts of procyanidins, and are often promoted for use in chronic conditions. Pine bark extract showed antioxidant, anti-inflammatory , immunostimulant , cardioprotective , and neuroprotective effects in preclinical studies. It may also have antimicrobial activities . Preliminary clinical data suggest it may reduce menopausal , dysmenorrheic , and osteoarthritic symptoms. A pine bark extract formulation improved oxidative stress and bone turnover markers in postmenopausal osteopenic women , and improved nutrition and clinical status in critically ill patients . Other data suggest pine bark extract may improve hyperpigmentation , erythema , and symptoms of endometriosis and lupus . Improvements in endothelial dysfunction and chronic venous insufficiency were also reported, but a meta-analyses found no benefit with pycnogenol on blood pressure , and insignificant effects cardiometabolic health . Another meta-analysis recommended against pycnogenol for musculoskeletal pain .Pycnogenol may enhance memory in elderly participants , but studies in adults and children with ADHD yielded mixed results . When used in conjunction with L-arginine, pycnogenol improved erectile dysfunction symptoms . Preliminary data suggest pycnogenol may reduce some adverse effects of radiotherapy and chemotherapy , but further research is needed. Systematic reviews have concluded that evidence is insufficient and that large-scale studies are needed to establish the value of various pine bark extract supplements for chronic disorders .",,"The primary constituents of pine bark extracts are procyanidins and phenolic acids (35). Pine bark extract acts as an antioxidant by scavenging reactive oxygen and nitrogen species and suppressing production of peroxides (21). It increases the activities of antioxidant enzymes by increasing the intracellular glutathione levels (22). In addition to increasing NO production which induces vasodilation (2), pine bark extract also blocks the NF-kB activation stimulated by tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and inhibits production of adhesion proteins that cause inflammation and atherosclerosis (22).In vitro, pycnogenol induced apoptosis in human breast cancer cells (23) and reduced neuronal apoptosis, an important feature of Alzheimer’s disease, by decreasing free radical generation (24). In animal studies, cardioprotective effects were also attributed to free radical scavenging (20).",Needles | Buds | Whole,French Marine Pine Bark Extract | Pine Bark | Procyanidin Oligomers | PCOs,Pinus silvestris | Pinus spp | Pinus canadensis | Pinus Tabuliformis,Chinese Pine | Korean Pine | Masson Pine | Mugo Pine | Monterey Pine | Maratime Pine | Pine | Pine (unspecified) | Scots Pine | White Pine,Pine Bark Extract,

It is also found in some popular medicinal plants including ginkgo biloba and St. John’s Wort and is used widely for its antioxidant effects. Quercetin showed antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and chemopreventive effects in vitro. However, it can also act as an anti-apoptotic agent . Animal models showed its ability to potentiate the antitumor effects of doxorubicin in liver cancer cells, while protecting normal liver cells . Quercetin also demonstrated neuroprotective and antidepressant effects , exerted pro-oxidant effects by decreasing serum homocysteine levels , and protected against osteoarthritis .In clinical studies, long-term supplementation had wide-ranging metabolic effects in healthy subjects . But concomitant intake of quercetin did not attenuate postprandial metabolic responses such as lipemia and insulinemia or increase the concentration of alpha linoleic acid, and its conversion to omega-3 fatty acids, which is associated with cardiovascular benefits . Supplementation also did not affect endothelial dysfunction biomarkers or depression levels in post myocardial infarction patients .In other studies, quercetin attenuated the severity of muscle weakness caused by eccentric exercise , reduced oxidative damage following eccentric exercise , and enhanced neuromuscular performance during and after resistance training . In women with rheumatoid arthritis, supplementation improved clinical symptoms and disease activity . A quercetin containing formula was comparable to omeprazole for treating nonerosive gastroesophageal reflux disease .Meta analyses determined quercetin to be among the active components in TCM formulas that improved overall survival in metastatic colorectal patients and fatigue in those with gastric cancer . But findings from a systematic review showed quercetin obtained from a typical diet may not decrease the risk of ovarian cancer . It also exacerbated estrogen-induced breast tumors in a murine model . Further research is warranted.",,"Quercetin constitutes the major bioflavonoid in the human diet. Its antioxidant effects are due its phenolic group, which reacts with free radicals to form the more stable phenoxy radicals (1). Quercetin also exerts anti-inflammatory (13) and chemopreventive (15) properties. It also has been shown to have membrane-stabilizing capabilities and inhibits aldose reductase and low-density lipoprotein oxidation (8). The anti-cancer effects of quercetin are via down regulation of mutant p53 proteins; G1 phase arrest (1); tyrosine kinase inhibition (10); and down regulation of cell survival, proliferative and anti-apoptotic proteins (15). Preclinical data support the concept of quercetin as an anti-cancer compound (15).

It is rich in immunoglobulins, growth factors, and cytokines, and confers immune protection to the newborn calf from opportunistic infections. Bovine colostrum has been used as a dietary supplement to treat diarrhea, infections, and colitis, and to improve athletic performance. In vitro studies suggest that bovine colostrum has anti-inflammatory and chemopreventive properties. Several clinical trials suggest that hyperimmune bovine colostrum, prepared by immunizing cows with the causative agent, is effective in treating diarrhea caused by rotavirus , E. Coli , and Cryptosporidium parvum . In human challenge trials, specially formulated bovine colostral-IgG preparations provided protection against some enterotoxigenic E. coli strains . Other small studies suggest bovine colostrum supplementation may reduce GI problems including diarrhea in ICU-hospitalized patients and in children . There is also some data suggesting it may prevent gastrointestinal damage caused by NSAIDs or help treat distal colitis . In perioperative settings, data suggest that oral bovine colostrum may reduce endotoxemia in patients undergoing abdominal surgery and postoperative plasma C-reactive protein levels in patients undergoing coronary bypass surgery . Although it is thought to have immunological benefits, meta-analyses found a lack of evidence for colostrum in either preterm infants or physically active adults . Evidence is also lacking on whether it could help prevent hemolytic uremic syndrome from E. coli infections . In a study of children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, prophylactic bovine colostrum had no effect on fever or infection, although oral mucositis severity was significantly reduced . Bovine colostrum contains trace amounts of naturally occurring estrogen . Therefore, patients with hormone-sensitive cancers should discuss this product with their physicians before consumption. In addition, individuals allergic to dairy products should avoid this product.",,"Although the high concentration of immunoglobulins may account for bovine colostrum’s effects, the exact mechanism is not known. Studies suggest that bovine colostrum improves exercise performance (9) (10) by increasing serum insulin-like growth factor I and may enhance immune response in humans (11), although a meta-analysis found that evidence is lacking (27). Other studies suggest that colostrum derived from cows immunized with C. parvum is effective against diarrhea induced by C. parvum in AIDS patients (3) (4).

DSI000613,Dioscorea villosa,C0697076,"Derived from the root of a twining vine, wild yam was traditionally used for its antispasmodic and anti-inflammatory properties to treat menopausal symptoms, gastrointestinal ailments, muscle spasm, asthma, joint pain, and rheumatoid arthritis . Wild yam has antiproliferative and antimitotic effects in vitro. Animal models suggest antinociceptive, anti-inflammatory, and antidiabetic effects . In other preclinical studies, the active constituent diosgenin had estrogenic and progestogenic effects and restored moderately decreased sperm motility in mice . Dioscorin, another protein, appeared to reduce weight gain and total visceral lipids, and improve impaired glucose tolerance in mice . Small studies on whether wild yam can relieve menopausal symptoms are mixed: one suggested that an oral D. alata formula was more effective than placebo , but another showed a topical D. villosa formula was ineffective . In other small studies, an oral diosgenin-rich yam extract appeared to enhance cognitive function , and sex hormone and lipid profiles appeared to improve with dietary yam intake . However, larger studies are needed to confirm whether wild yam in any form actually has any benefits for menopausal symptoms. Wild yam extract is sold as a dietary supplement, liquid extract, or cream. Diosgenin in wild yam has been used as raw material for synthetic progesterone, but there is no evidence that the human body can convert diosgenin into progesterone. Because wild yam has estrogenic effects, patients with hormone-sensitive cancers should talk to their physicians before consumption.",,"The steroid saponin diosgenin in wild yam modulates cell signaling involved in growth, differentiation, apoptosis, and oncogenesis (14). In vitro studies suggest wild yam extract protects against human breast cancer proliferation by acting as a weak phytoestrogen (3). A molecular docking study of estrogen mimics in phytochemicals from dietary herbal supplements found that D. villosa docked strongly with the estrogen receptor (23). However, the D. villosa species has been noted to induce chronic kidney injury via profibrotic pathways in animal models (15).",Root,Colic root | Devil’s bones | Rheumatism root | Yuma | Wild yam root,Dioscorea villosa,Wild Yam,Wild Yam,

Patients use it in conjunction with conventional therapies to prevent and treat cancer, AIDS, promote weight gain, and as an immunostimulant. Animal studies of Sun Soup suggest antitumor effects. Studies in humans are quite limited and preliminary, however. When administered concurrently with conventional therapies, the product was associated with improved survival, weight maintenance, and improved Karnofsky Performance Scale Score in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer . Larger randomized studies are needed to confirm these findings.",,"The inventor suggests that antitumor activities of compounds in some constituents act synergistically (1). Quantitative analysis of freeze-dried powder (DSV) revealed approximately 63 mg inositol hexaphosphate (IP6), 2.6 mg genistein, 4.4 mg daidzein, and 15.5 mg coumestrol per serving (2). Preclinical studies performed with IP6 suggest that it slows initiation or promotion, inhibits proliferation by chelation of metalloproteins, causes G0/G1 arrest, and induces differentiation of various cancer cell lines. In vitro, genistein inhibits angiogenesis, induces DNA damage in cancer cell lines, and along with daidzein and coumestrol, inhibits the growth of human prostate cancer cells (3). Genistein and coumestrol also induced NADPH:quinone reductase, a detoxifying phase II enzyme in colonic cells, leading to possible antitumor effects (4).Shiitake mushrooms contain the polysaccharide lentinan, which may act as an immunomodulator and enhance production of IL-1, TNF, LAK, cytotoxic T lymphocytes, and cytotoxic peritoneal exudate cells.

It is thought to have antiseptic, diuretic, and emetic properties and is used to reduce inflammation, cough, infections, and as an anti-plaque agent. Bloodroot is also an ingredient in black salve, which is promoted as an alternative cancer treatment. The major constituent of bloodroot is sanguinarine, an alkaloid that exhibits antimicrobial , tumoricidal , anticancer , antiangiogenic and antimicrotubule properties. However, its efficacy has not been tested in humans. Topical use of bloodroot for skin cancer can lead to severe adverse effects including disfigurement . The use of sanguinarine as an oral antiplaque agent has been linked to leukoplakia .",,"Laboratory studies suggest sanguinarine, a benzophenanthrine alkaloid, has potential antineoplastic properties, as it intercalates with DNA at guanine-cytosine-rich sequences (17). Sanguinarine also inhibits transcription factor NFkB (6) and tubulin protein formation (21), activates pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins (2), and induces apoptosis (3) perhaps via increased activation of caspases 3 and 9 (27).
Sanguinarine exhibits antiplatelet effects, reduces platelet thromboxane production, and suppresses cyclooxygenase-1 (13). Bloodroot can inhibit the action of sodium-potassium ATPase and also prolong ventricular refractory period (18) (19).
Antiplaque effects may be caused by conversion of sanguinarine to an iminium ion that binds to plaque.

It is also used as a diuretic, and should not be confused with Scutellaria baicalensis. In vitro studies suggest that S. barbata has antibacterial , antioxidant , antimutagenic , and anticancer properties. A number of constituents including flavonoids are thought to be responsible for these activities. Animal models also suggest antitumor activity with S. barbata across a range of cancers . However, different extraction methodologies and/or plant origins have yielded varying degrees of antitumor effects . A large long-term population study identified S. barbata among the single herbs used in TCM that may reduce risk of hepatocellular carcinoma in hepatitis B patients . Another study found association with improved overall survival . Small studies also suggest it is safe and may benefit patients with advanced breast cancer . Further research is needed to confirm these effects.",,"S. barbata possesses a range of antitumor activities via multiple intracellular targets (20), with major anticancer constituents identified as scutellarin, apigenin5-O-β-glucopyranoside, apigenin, p-coumaric acid, luteolin and 4’-hydroxywogonin (22). Polysaccharides in S. barbata demonstrate antioxidant and free radical-scavenging activity (15). Flavonoids and scutebarbatines can regulate immune function, with decreases in IL-17, IL-10, FOXP3, TGF-beta1, RORgammat, and IL-6 levels, and increases in IL-2 and IFN-gamma levels (23). Neo-clerodane diterpenoids also have demonstrated anticancer (24) and antiviral (25) activities.
Preclinical studies of S. barbata  have focused mostly on colon, lung, and liver cancer models. In human colon cancer cells, S. barbata induces apoptosis and inhibits cell proliferation and angiogenesis via Akt and p53 modulation, Bax/Bcl-2 upregulation, decreased cyclin D1/CDK4 expression, G1/S cell cycle arrest, VEGF-A inhibition, and increased p21 expression (19) (20) (26) (27). In lung tumor models, S. barbata inhibits hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha and VEGF expression (18). Polysaccharides inhibit proliferation and downregulate phospho-c-Met expression and downstream phospho-Erk/Akt signaling (18). Apoptotic effects with the alkaloid scutebarbatine A occurs via cytochrome c and caspase-3/9 upregulation, and Bcl-2 downregulation (28).
In liver tumors, S. barbata flavonoids suppressed angiogenesis via VEGF regulation, MMP2/9 inhibition, and increased TIMP1/2 expression (17) (29). Total flavonoids induced increases in DNA fragmentation and mitochondrial pathway apoptosis (30). S. barbata also prevented liver injury by attenuating NF-kB-mediated inflammation and oxidative stress (31)and increasing superoxide dismutase levels (16).
S. barbata flavonoids have produced synergistic effects in combination with cisplatin in ovarian cancer cells (32). A proprietary aqueous S. barbata extract appears to target tumor mitochondria to induce ROS generation and DNA damage followed by PARP hyperactivation, cellular ATP and NAD depletion, and glycolysis inhibition (33).",Herb,Barbat skullcap | Ban Zhi Lian | Banjiryun,Scutellaria barbata,,Scutellaria barbata,

It is used as a component in traditional Chinese herbal formulas for blood circulation and to relieve pain. A purified alkaloid extract from this plant known as huperzine A has neuroprotective effects and has been developed as a treatment for Alzheimer’s disease and dementia in Asia . In the US, it is available as a dietary supplement to promote cognitive function. It is also used by some cancer patients to relieve pain and neurological dysfunction due to chemotherapy. Most studies on H. serrata are based on the extract huperzine A, which selectively inhibits acetylcholinesterase . Animal studies suggest antiapoptotic, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidative properties may contribute to its protective effects in nerve agent poisoning , myasthenia gravis , hepatic reperfusion injury , and diabetes-associated cognitive decline . Clinical studies on huperzine A for Alzheimer’s disease have yielded mixed results , but a meta-analysis suggests that it may help mild to moderate cognitive dysfunction . One study found it improved cognitive function in vascular dementia patients . More well-designed studies are needed to determine safety and effectiveness. Although a US patent has been filed claiming its use for cancer pain and neuropathy , no clinical trials for these indications have been conducted. Mild adverse effects from huperzine have been reported . Because it acts as an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, it can potentially interact with many drugs including other anticholinergic drugs, dopamine D2 receptor blockers, calcium channel blockers, and beta adrenergic receptor antagonists .",,"Huperzine A is an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, thereby raising acetylcholine levels in the basal ganglia (1). Higher levels of acetylcholine in the central nervous system are believed to be responsible for less severe cognitive impairment in Alzheimer’s disease (1). Additionally, huperzine can interfere with the pathway of beta-amyloid deposition by regulating precursor protein metabolism and impeding associated neurotoxicity (13). Huperzine also inhibits the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors in the cerebral cortex (14).
Huperzine diminished diabetes-associated cognitive decline in rats by enhancing glycemic control, suppressing inflammation, augmenting brain-derived neurotrophic factor expression, and limiting oxidative stress (5). In a mouse model of hepatic ischemia reperfusion injury, the antioxidative, anti-inflammatory, and antiapoptotic properties of huperzine contributed to hepatoprotective effects (4).",Whole plant,Chinese club moss | Huperzine; Hup A | Qian Ceng Ta | She Zu Cao | Jin Bu Huan; Shan Zhi,Huperzia serrata,,Huperzia serrata,

Pectin is used as a gelling agent in food. It is also used as a remedy for diarrhea, to lower cholesterol, or to improve satiety. Modified Citrus Pectin (MCP) is an altered form of pectin that has shorter carbohydrate chains and is claimed to be better absorbed by the body. Preclinical studies suggest inhibitory effects with pectin in colon , breast , liver , and lung cancer cell lines. Preliminary clinical data suggest that pectin is beneficial in treating diarrhea and reducing levels of toxic heavy metals . Pectin may also be helpful for hypercholesterolemia , but one study showed that source and type of pectin influences its activity . Another study also demonstrated that different types pectin are varied in their properties and may affect appetite and energy intake differently . Pectin has been promoted for reducing colon cancer risk and damage from radiation therapy, but there is insufficient scientific evidence to support these uses. In a small nonrandomized study, MCP increased the doubling time of prostate-specific antigen in patients with prostate cancer . Gastrointestinal side effects such as abdominal cramps and diarrhea have been reported with use of pectin .",,"Pectin-induced apoptosis in adenocarcinoma cells in vitro via caspase-3 activity resulting in DNA degradation (1). Modified Citrus Pectin (MCP) acts as a ligand for galectin-3, which plays a major role in tumor formation and progression (7) (8).

DSI000793,Echinacea,C0752270,"The genus Echinacea belongs to the family Compositae, commonly referred to as the sunflower family. Of the known species, E. purpurea, E. angustifolia, and E. pallida are commonly used in herbal medicine. Extracts derived from the root and aerial parts are widely used in Europe and the United States as nonspecific immunostimulants and to prevent or treat the common cold and influenza. However, natural products differ greatly in composition , mainly due to the use of different species, variable plant materials or extraction methods, and the addition of other components. Preclinical studies suggest immunostimulatory and anti-inflammatory effects . A standardized echinacea preparation inactivated influenza viruses and may improve respiratory activity . In animal models, echinacea stimulated erythropoiesis, increased blood-oxygen transport , produced anxiolytic effects , and exhibited wound-healing properties .Clinical data indicate that echinacea is ineffective in preventing the common cold caused by rhinoviruses or in treating upper respiratory infections but positive findings were reported with higher doses . Studies of its ability to reduce incidence and duration of the common cold yielded mixed results . Other analyses do not indicate any benefits for treating colds, and weak evidence for a prophylactic benefit , but a large randomized trial found an echinacea formulation to be as effective as oseltamivir for influenza, and with fewer adverse events in the echinacea group . In a review of 17 clinical trials involving 3,363 participants, echinacea supplements were found to affect reductions in pro-inflammatory cytokines that play a role in the progression of cytokine storm and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) . Echinacea was also reported useful in preventing respiratory tract infections and reducing associated antibiotic usage in children .Small studies have shown that a standardized echinacea root extract has immunomodulating activity ; an echinacea/sage spray was useful in treating acute sore throats ; and a formula containing dry root extracts of Echinacea purpurea and Echinacea angustifolia may be useful as an adjuvant therapy for decreasing relapse incidence in patients treated for genital condylomatosis and in those with cervical low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions . Data on anxiolytic effects are mixed but findings on improving or enhancing athletic performance are mixed . A topical echinacea extract was reported effective in alleviating symptoms associated with atopic eczema . Echinacea may also have anticancer potential evidenced by the cytotoxic effects exerted by an extract and a major compound, cichoric acid, in human colon cancer cells .Some studies suggest that echinacea could decrease plasma levels, affect therapeutic efficacy, or cause adverse effects with some anticancer drugs . In HIV-infected patients, co-administration with etravirine was found to be safe and well tolerated . In a large population-based study, use of echinacea was associated with a slight increase in diastolic blood pressure . There is insufficient evidence regarding the efficacy and safety of echinacea during pregnancy .",,"Echinacea’s active constituents include cichoric and caftaric acids, polysaccharides, and alkylamides (47). Immune-modulating effects of a standardized echinacea root extract include upregulation of interleukin (IL)-2 and IL-8 and downregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and IL-6 (39). Immunemodulation by alkylamides occurs through binding to human cannabinoid receptors 1 and 2, and by inhibiting TNF-alpha (48). Alkylamides may also be responsible for anti-inflammatory effects (27). Although echinacea does not appear to have significant ergogenic or anabolizing effects, it appears to enhance the immune system and decrease oxidative damage (49).In vitro and in vivo, echinacea extracts were shown to stimulate phagocytosis, enhance mobility of leukocytes, stimulate TNF and IL-1 secretion from macrophages and lymphocytes, and improve respiratory activity (2) (3). However, their effects on innate immunity such as phagocytosis could not be confirmed, and showed only minimal effects on tumor progression, although echinacea did stimulate natural killer cell activity (50). Other studies suggest that bacterial components of echinacea are responsible for immune benefits, as total bacterial load differences and content of bacterial lipopolysaccharides within echinacea samples have correlated with NF-kappaB activation in THP-1 cells (51).In human colon cancer cells, cichoric acid decreased telomerase activity and induced apoptosis via DNA fragmentation, caspase-9 activation, poly-ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) cleavage and beta-catenin downregulation (42). Differential effects of echinacea on intestinal and hepatic CYP3A activities may be due to systemic unavailability of locally-acting constituents that inhibit CYP3A, or rapid absorption of these constituents that limits intestinal exposure and CYP3A induction, or a systemically-formed constituent metabolite that is capable of inducing hepatic but not intestinal CYP3A (52).",Plante entière,Coneflower; purple coneflower | Black Sampson; Sampson root | Sonnenhut | Igelkopfwurzel,Echinacea,Echinacea (unspecified) | Echinacea (various) | Echinacea | Echinacea (mixed),Echinacea,

DSI000811,Magnolia officinalis,C1037682,"Magnolia officinalis is a flowering herb that has been used in traditional Chinese medicine to treat anxiety, depression, stress, nervousness, and sleep-related problems. It is also used to regulate gastrointestinal motility and is found in herbal formulas such as Ma Zi Ren Wan. The bark contains the active constituents magnolol and honokiol. Preclinical studies suggest these compounds have antimicrobial , anti-inflammatory , antidiabetic , antidepressant , anxiolytic , and neuroprotective effects. They have also been evaluated for their anticancer potential. Magnolol demonstrated activity against a variety of cancers, including bladder , prostate , colorectal , breast , and lung cancers. Honokiol also showed antitumor and antiangiogenic effects in leukemia , lung , bladder , prostate , melanoma , breast , glioblastoma , neuroblastoma , and oral cancer cells lines. In murine models, honokiol enhanced low-dose docetaxel treatment against prostate cancer growth and bone metastasis , and reduced breast tumor growth biomarkers . Data in humans are limited. Preliminary clinical studies suggest benefits with magnolia for vasomotor symptoms , weight management , and oral health . However, these studies used magnolia in combination with other compounds. In patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, a magnolia extract was shown to be useful in reducing hepatic fat content .",,"In THP-1 cells, magnolol and honokiol reduced inflammatory TNF-α and IL-8 production induced by Propionibacterium acnes  (3). Other anti-inflammatory markers reduced by magnolia bark extract include IL-6 as well as MMP2 and MMP9 (4). Antihyperglycemic effects with magnolia bark extract are attributed to the inhibition of protein tyrosine phosphatase enzyme 1B, a negative regulator of the insulin signaling pathway, which increases ERK phosphorylation and GLUt4 translocation (5). Magnolol increased both insulin-stimulated glucose transport and production of GLUT1 and GLUT4 mRNA, and GLUT4 protein (6).
A combination of honokiol and magnolol normalized biochemical abnormalities in brain 5-HT and 5-HIAA, serum corticosterone levels, and platelet adenylyl cyclase activity, a biomarker for depression in chronically stressed rodents (7). Anxiolytic effects of honokiol are attributed to its selective stimulation of GABA-A receptors or its binding to anxiety-related sites (8).
A number of anticancer mechanisms have been identified with magnolol. In human bladder cancer cells, it induced p27KIP1-mediated G2/M-phase cell cycle arrest to activate the extracellular signal-regulated kinase pathway (11), and decreased binding of transcription factor NF-kB to DNA to inhibit MMP9 expression (12). In prostate cancer cells, magnolol affected insulin-like growth factor-1 expression and associated binding proteins (13), inhibited the EGFR/PI3K/Akt signaling pathway (16), and downregulated MMP2 and MMP9 proteins and mRNA levels (15). Antitumor activity also occurred via MMP9 inhibition through the NF-kB pathway in breast cancer cells (19) and through AMPK activation in colorectal cancer cells (18).
Antitumor and antiangiogenic properties of honokiol are attributed to NF-kB inhibition and the consequent scavenging of reactive oxygen species (24). In human endothelial cells, honokiol inhibited vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 phosphorylation (25). It also blocked VEGF-induced Rac to prevent migration of malignant endothelial cells (25), blocked signaling pathways in tumor cells with defective p53 (23), and suppressed NF-kB overactivity (24). In acute myeloid leukemia cells, honokiol inhibited STAT3 signaling via increased protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP1 expression (26). In glioma cells, it induced autophagy and activated a p53/cyclin D1/CDK6/CDK4/E2F1-dependent pathway to induce apoptosis and cell cycle arrest (34) and in prostate cancer cells, honokiol suppressed c-Myc protein expression (30).
In animal models of prostate cancer with bone metastasis, honokiol induced apoptosis via caspase-3,-8, and -9 activation and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage (37). As a potential P-glycoprotein inhibitor, constituents of magnolia bark extract may reduce multidrug resistance in cancer cells via P-gp downregulation (42) (43).",Rhizome bark,Magnolia bark extract | Magnolol | Houpu magnolia | Hou Po,Magnolia officinalis,,Magnolia officinalis,

An intravenous form has been evaluated in preliminary studies to evaluate whether it can slow progression of cardiovascular disease. IP6 is also marketed as a supplement to support natural cellular defense. Preclinical studies suggest IP6 has anticancer and antiangiogenic effects. Preliminary data in humans suggest IP6 supplementation may improve fasting serum uric acid levels in hyperuricemic subjects and inhibit formation of advanced glycation end products in patients with type-2 diabetes . Other data suggest benefit for alleviating chemotherapy-induced side effects and improving quality of life in breast cancer patients . Similar benefits were reported with topical IP6 . In another study, myo-inositol showed chemopreventive potential in patients with bronchial dysplasia . Larger studies are warranted to confirm these findings .",,"IP6 can be synthesized from inositol or obtained from the diet. Metabolites and derivatives of IP6 perform secondary messenger roles, including mobilization of intracellular calcium for mitosis. Extracellular signaling also has been demonstrated. IP6 interacts with both tyrosine kinase and PLC-coupled growth factor receptors. IP6 also enters the inositol phosphates pool, is subsequently dephosphorylated, and contributes to additional cellular signal transduction and intracellular functions (1).
In vitro and animal studies suggest that IP6 reduces initiation and/or promotion, inhibits proliferation by chelation of metalloproteins, causes G0/G1 arrest, and induces differentiation of various cancer cell lines (3) (4). IP6 also may inhibit in vitro platelet activation with ADP, collagen, and thrombin by interacting with platelet cytoskeletal reorganization, P13-K activity, or agonist-induced platelet aggregation (2).","Aspergillus niger - Whole | Phytic acid | Aspergillus niger - Whole | Cereal, grains, legumes, meat",IP6; InsP-6 | Phytic acid; Phytate | Inositol hexakisphosphate | Myo-inositol hexaphosphate,myo-Inositol-hexakisphosphate 3-phosphohydrolase | myo-Inositol hexakis(dihydrogen phosphate) | myo-Inositol-hexakisphosphate 4-phosphohydrolase,,Inositol Hexaphosphate,

DSI000961,Uncaria tomentosa,C0939876,"Cat’s claw is a vine native to South America, the bark of which has been used in traditional medicine to treat various conditions such as gastric and inflammatory disorders . It is marketed as a dietary supplement to support the body’s natural defenses, for digestive and joint health, and as a general health tonic. In vitro studies suggest some of the plant constituents have antiviral, antimutagenic, anti-inflammatory, and immunomodulatory properties, and may enhance phagocytosis . Anticancer effects have also been observed , and bioassays suggest cat’s claw may increase neutrophil count . Data in humans are limited. Small studies suggest cat’s claw may be helpful for active rheumatoid arthritis and denture stomatitis . It also reduced chemotherapy adverse effects in a study of breast cancer patients , and improved quality of life in patients with advanced cancer . However preclinical data of a cat’s claw extract showed it could stimulate survival of pediatric leukemic cells . Therefore, larger studies evaluating safety and efficacy are needed.",,"Oxindole alkaloids in cat’s claw have immunostimulating properties in vitro, increasing phagocytotic activity and synthesis of WBCs (5) and enhancing T-helper cell function (2). Inhibition of TNFα production (3) (4) has been linked to observed anti-inflammatory activities. Mitraphylline isolated from cat’s claw was also identified as possessing anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting release of IL1α, 1β, 4, 17, and TNFα (21).
In other preclinical studies, aqueous extracts enhanced DNA repair after chemically-induced damage (22). Protection against oxidative DNA damage following UVB exposure may occur via enhanced base excision repair and inherent antioxidant effects (23). The biphasic manner in which cat’s claw modulates anxiety, initially inducing and then reversing the effect after long-term administration, is attributed to the presence of alkaloids and flavonols (18).
The quinovic acid glycoside purified fraction of cat’s claw inhibited human bladder cancer cells via NF-κB modulation to induce apoptosis (20). Cat’s claw also inhibited lactate dehydrogenase-A, an enzyme highly expressed in malignant and treatment-resistant tumors with poor clinical outcomes (24). In vivo studies demonstrated antineoplastic effects against breast tumors due to modulation of oxidative stress and synergy among constituents with antioxidant properties, rather than alkaloid activity (12).",Stem bark,Una de gato | Saventaro | Life-giving vine of Peru | Hawk's claw,Uncaria tomentosa,Cat's Claw,Cat's Claw,

DSI001018,Sophora flavescens,C1014921,"Sophora flavescens is a deciduous shrub related to peas. The root known as “Kushen” which means “bitter root” in Chinese, has been used in Traditional Medicine for two thousand years to treat a variety of conditions including diarrhea, jaundice, and skin rashes, and to kill parasites . Although this herb is generally not consumed as a dietary supplement in the West, recent lab studies indicate that it has antitumor properties and patients are using it as a natural cancer treatment. Matrine, an alkaloid present in Sophora flavescens, demonstrated antitumor effects against liver , breast , pancreatic , myeloma and gastric cancer cell lines. Other flavonoids such as kuraninone and sophoraflavonone are also thought to be biologically active and may have vasodilatory and antiviral effects , and benefit patients with ulcerative colitis . Adjunctive use of formulas containing Kushen may improve effectiveness of chemotherapy in patients with non-small cell lung cancer . Sophora flavescens acts as a phytoestrogen and therefore, patients with hormone-sensitive cancers should avoid this product.",,"In animal models, the antiviral properties of sophoridine, an alkaloid constituent, appear to be mediated via upregulation of IL-10 and IFN-gamma cytokines (11). S. flavescens flavonoids may promote vasodilation by inhibiting Ca2+ influx through a voltage-gated channel (12). The flavonoids sophoraflavonone G and kurarinone may be responsible for antioxidant effects, which are mediated through free-radical scavenging (4). Anti-inflammatory effects of Sophoraflavonone G are attributed to inhibition of prostaglandin E2 formation via COX-2 downregulation (13). (2S)-2’-Methoxykurarinone isolated from S. flavescens root inhibits osteoclast differentiation and bone resorption via receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB ligand (RANKL)-induced mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and c-Fos-NFATc1 signaling pathways (29).
Most reported antineoplastic effects of S.flavescens are due to the proapoptotic activity of matrine, the main alkaloid constituent. In human hepatocellular carcinoma cells, matrine inhibits matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) by downregulating the NF-kappa B pathway (18). It also demonstrates antiangiogenic effects by inhibiting VEGF and VEGFR-2 (19). Matrine triggers the mitochondrial pathway, in which cytochrome C release induces caspase-9 and -3 activation and subsequently induces apoptosis (2) (3) (10) (21).",Root,Ku Shen Gen | Bitter root | Yellow sophora root,Sophora flavescens,Sophora flavescens | Shrubby Sophora,Sophora flavescens,

DSI001097,"Benzo(g)-1,3-benzodioxolo(5,6-a)quinolizinium, 5,6-dihydro-9,10-dimethoxy-",C0005117,"Berberine is an alkaloid constituent active in a number of plant species including barberry (Berberis vulgaris), Chinese goldthread (Coptis chinensis), goldenseal (Hydrastis canadensis), tree turmeric (Berberis aristata), and Oregon grape (Berberis aquifolium) . It has a deep yellow color with fluorescent properties and has long been used as a dye. Berberine is commonly used in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), Ayurveda, and other medicinal traditions to treat infections, diarrhea, and inflammatory disorders. In China, it is frequently used for the adjuvant treatment of type 2 diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and hypertension . As a supplement, it is marketed to support already normal glucose and lipid metabolism. Preclinical studies suggest antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and atheroprotective properties , as well as potential antitumor effects . Preliminary data suggest some benefit for patients with irritable bowel syndrome and to improve metabolic and endocrine markers in women with polycystic ovary syndrome . In patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis , berberine reduced hepatic fat and improved metabolic and lipid profiles. Adjunctive use also reduced the risk of glycolipid metabolic disturbances in patients with schizophrenia and reduced inflammatory markers in patients with acute coronary syndrome following percutaneous coronary intervention . Meta-analyses evaluating trials of berberine for dyslipidemia suggest improved lipid profiles, although many studies were heterogeneous, of low quality, or had a high risk of bias , and a review indicates the magnitude of effect to be small . Other meta-analyses of berberine for hyperlipidemia, hypertension, or diabetes also determined that most studies are of limited quality . One analysis that showed benefit in type 2 diabetic patients suggests it may be more helpful in younger patients or with short-term treatment , while another associated berberine with anthropometric improvements that may indirectly affect metabolic disease symptoms . Data also indicate that berberine and probiotics have a synergistic hyperlipidemic effect in type-2 diabetic patients . Berberine was also found effective in reducing the risk of recurrence of colorectal adenoma, and may be useful as a chemopreventive following polypectom . In addition, berberine has been studied in combination with other supplements. Data suggest a nutraceutical combination including berberine, red yeast rice , policosanol, astaxanthin, folic acid, and CoQ10 may lower cholesterol in HIV patients on antiretroviral therapy . It also improved lipid profiles in statin-intolerant patients with coronary heart disease . In hypercholesterolemic patients with moderate CVD risk, another nutraceutical containing berberine and red yeast rice yielded lower LDL and triglycerides with better tolerance than with ezetimibe, but did not affect HDL . However oral bioavailability of berberine is considered poor , and monacolin K in red yeast rice has statin-like side effects, prompting the continued search for other enhanced-bioavailability berberine/nutraceutical combinations . More generally, the consensus of an international lipid expert panel is that evidence for use of either a single or combination lipid-lowering nutraceutical is limited and variable, but that berberine may have benefit for prevention, particularly in patients with mild hypercholesterolemia who are statin-intolerant or have metabolic syndrome . In healthy subjects, berberine did not increase side effects when used in combination with simvastatin or fenofibrate . Additional well-designed trials that test safety and efficacy of berberine both singly and in combination with other interventions are warranted.",,"Preclinical studies suggest atheroprotective effects with berberine are related to increased expression of hepatic low density lipoprotein receptor, reduced LDLR modulator proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9), and improvements in endothelial dysfunction (3). In animal models, berberine exhibited statin-like effects by reducing LDL and total cholesterol levels as well as aortic lesions, and improved glucose tolerance while reducing glucose levels, weight gain, and adipose tissue (3). Other models indicate berberine may also alter hepatic metabolism-related gene expression as it is favorably located in the liver (9).
In humans, cardioprotective effects are partly attributed to reduced myocardial autophagy and apoptosis via the AMPK/mTOR pathway (26). In patients with acute coronary syndrome, berberine adjunctive to standard care reduced inflammatory markers including matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9, intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1, and vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM)-1 (10). Improvements in fatty liver disease are facilitated by decreased levels of circulating ceramides (27).",Berberine hydrochloride | Berberis aristata - Whole plant,Berberine alkaloid | Berberine HCl | Daruharidra,"5,6-Dihydro-9,10-dimethoxybenzo(g)-1,3-benzodioxolo(5,6-a)quinolizinium chloride | 5,6-Dihydro-9,10-dimethoxybenzo(g)-1,3-benzodioxolo(5,6-a)quinolizinium sulfate",Berberine,Berberine,

DSI001172,Insulin,C1533581,"Insulin potentiation therapy (IPT) is an alternative cancer therapy that uses insulin to potentiate the effects of chemotherapy and other medications. This therapy was developed in Mexico by Dr. Donato Perez Garcia in the 1930s and has been used together with other unconventional therapies . Advocates of IPT believe that cancer cells consume more sugar than healthy cells and are therefore more sensitive to insulin and insulin-like growth factor (IGF) . Insulin is also believed to increase the permeability of cell membranes, increasing the intracellular concentration and cytotoxic effect of anticancer drugs . According to the theory underlying this therapy, if cancer cells can be activated by exogenous insulin, a reduced dose (up to one-tenth the normal dose) of a chemotherapy drug can provide the same cytotoxic effects with less severe adverse reactions. The pharmacokinetic profiles on concurrent use of insulin and chemotherapy drugs are lacking and it is unclear whether insulin also potentiates toxic effects of chemotherapy on healthy cells. Exploratory studies suggest some benefit with a combination of chemotherapy and IPT , but well-designed clinical trials have not been conducted. Many of the medications used in IPT, such as insulin and other chemotherapy drugs, are FDA-approved but IPT clinics administer them “off-label.” Furthermore, some clinics that administer IPT are not operated or staffed by oncologists. Side effects of IPT include hypoglycemic reaction. A systematic review of 21 studies showed a correlation between circulating levels of IGF-I, IGFBP3 (IGF-binding protein) and an increased risk of common cancers .",,"IPT is a treatment strategy that seeks to utilize the physiological activities of insulin. It is based on the theory that insulin and insulin-like growth factor (IGF) play an important role in the cell cycle. IGF has been shown to affect proliferation, adhesion, and migration of normal as well as cancerous cells (2) and certain IGF receptors are overexpressed in many forms of cancer. Therefore, cancer cells may be selectively more sensitive than normal cells to IGF (1) (7).
IGF receptors can be activated by exogenous insulin. Insulin is also believed to increase the permeability of cell membranes, leading to the increased intracellular concentrations and cytotoxic effects of anticancer drugs.
Proponents argue that insulin synergistically enhances cancer drug efficacy so that a reduced dose can be used with similar cytotoxic effects (5) (6), but the role of IGF receptors in cancer treatment is likely more complex.",Insulin,IPT,Insulin,Insulina,Insulin Potentiation Therapy,

Yohimbe is marketed as a steroid substitute, to enhance athletic performance, and for weight loss and energy support. The active component, an alkaloid called yohimbine, has been tested in clinical studies to treat sexual dysfunction . It was prescribed as an oral treatment for erectile dysfunction prior to the approval of PDE5 inhibitors, but there is a lack of direct evidence on its efficacy and safety . Data are also limited on the use of yohimbine for PTSD , orthostatic hypotension , athletic performance , and xerostomia . It is important to note that yohimbe products are among supplements with the largest number of documented contraindications , toxic effects , and severe events requiring hospitalization .",,"Effects on erectile dysfunction may result from inhibition of presynaptic-α1-adrenoceptor activity in cavernous smooth muscle cells and impact on NO and cGMP formation involving endothelium and endothelial NO synthase activity, which is testosterone-dependent (6) (17). Yohimbe also has dilatory effect on genital blood vessels, enhanced genital tissue sensation, and increased reflex excitability in the sacral region (4).
The active constituents are indole alkaloids including yohimbine (16), which possesses endothelin-like actions and affects NO production in renal circulation (18), and exerts anxiogenic effects through the noradrenergic pathway, which activates the HPA stress axis (19). As an α2-adrenoreceptor antagonist, yohimbine enhances norepinephrine release, increases parasympathomimetic activity, and reduces sympathetic activity (15) (20) (21). Blocking of α2-adrenoreceptors also results in increased blood supply to cavernous body tissue and increased plasma levels of noradrenaline by increasing its release from the sympathetic nervous system (4) (21). In patients with orthostatic hypotension, yohimbine produces a pressor effect by engaging residual sympathetic tone (8).","Alkaloid from bark of Coryanthe johimbe, related species, and Rauwolfia serpentina.",Yohimbe bark | Yohimbine | Johimbe | Aphrodine | Corynine | Quebrachine,Yohimbinum,Yohimbine | Yohimbe | 11-hydroxy yohimbine,Yohimbe,
DSI001241,Sarcandra glabra,C1041819,"Sarcandra glabra, an herb native to Southeast Asia, has been used in traditional Chinese medicine for the treatment of bruises, bone fractures, arthritis, nausea, internal pain, and cough . Some constituents are reported to have hepatoprotective and cytotoxic properties. In vitro studies suggest S. glabra can protect against oxidative stress in mesenchymal stem cells . An acidic polysaccharide from S. glabra exhibited anticancer effects in human osteosarcoma cells . S. glabra inhibited tumor growth in human leukemic cell lines . In animal studies, S. glabra constituents demonstrate anti-inflammatory and anti-diabetic activities. S. glabra increases platelet production and may play a role in reducing chemotherapy-induced thrombocytopenia . It also exhibits protective effects against viral pneumonia . Clinical observation in humans suggest S. glabra may be useful in the treatment of idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura . S. glabra extract is marketed to cancer patients to relieve fatigue and as an alternative cancer treatment, but it has not been evaluated for these uses in clinical trials. However, it may relieve some cancer treatment-induced symptoms. One human study found it reduced radiation therapy-induced mucositis and xerostomia in patients with advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma . More studies are needed to confirm whether S. glabra can indeed control some cancer treatment-related symptoms and to further validate any antitumor potential.",,"In animal models of influenza virus, S. glabra improved susceptibility marker levels and inhibited inflammatory cytokines via downregulation of NF-κB protein expression to diminish lung injury. This may be in part due to antiviral and anti-inflammatory effects of major constituents including rosmarinic acid, caffeoylquinic acid, and caffeic acid (6).
Caffeic acid 3,4-dihydroxyphenethyl ester (CADPE), a polyphenol component, has indicated some antitumor activity in animal models through inhibition of tumor angiogenesis, induction of cancer cell senescence, and modulation of multiple cellular targets and signal pathways (7). An ethyl acetate extract of S. glabra inhibits proliferation and viability of human promyelocytic leukemic HL-60 cells by arresting the cell cycle S phase via upregulation of Bax, a proapoptotic factor (8).
Generally, active components in S. glabra are more abundant in the stem than leaf (14) and concentrations of constituents vary when examining S. glabra from different provenances.",Herb top,Herba Sarcandrae | Zhong Jie Feng | Glabrous Sarcandra Herb | Cao Shan Hu; Caoshanhu,Sarcandra glabra,,Sarcandra glabra,

DSI001261,Annona muricata,C1000635,"Graviola is a tree prevalent in the rain forests of Africa, South America, and Southeast Asia. The fruits, also known as soursop, are consumed as food. The leaves and stems are used in traditional medicine for symptoms associated with inflammation and infection. Graviola is also available as a dietary supplement and widely promoted as an alternative treatment for cancer, although clinical evidence is lacking. In some Caribbean countries, it is one of the common herbal remedies used among prostate, breast, and colorectal cancer patients . Perceived health benefits of graviola are attributed to its antioxidant properties . In animal models, graviola extracts showed anti-inflammatory , analgesic , antidiabetic , antiulcer , and antiviral effects. The leaf extracts also have antimicrobial activities . Lab studies have also evaluated extracts from the graviola leaf, fruit, and seed for their anticancer effects. Some of these studies suggest activity against breast , lung , colon , prostate , pancreatic , liver , and skin cancer cell lines, but human studies are lacking. In addition, it is unclear whether the neurotoxicity identified in preclinical studies may translate to humans, as one systematic review suggests a favorable profile with graviola leaf extract , so more studies are needed to determine safety and efficacy.",,"Annonaceous acetogenins isolated from the leaves, bark, and twigs are among the active constituents (35). Graviola-induced cell death inhibited by glucose supplementation suggests energy depletion (20). Graviola has also been shown to stimulate serotonin receptors (24). Cell-stimulating behaviors may occur either by increased mitochondrial turnover or by preparation to leave the G1 phase, possibly through a promitotic stimulus present within the extract which acts like a growth factor (28).
In animal models, antidiabetic effects are due to antioxidant, hypolipidemic, and protective effects in pancreatic beta-cells, which improves glucose metabolism (7). Antiulcer effects may occur via increased nitric oxide and prostaglandin E2 activities (8). Anti-inflammatory and analgesic actions with a fruit extract occurred via COX-1/2 inhibition and the blocking of opioid receptors (5).
Graviola extracts were effective against adriamycin-resistant human mammary adenocarcinoma by blocking ATP access and inhibiting plasma membrane glycoprotein (29). Inhibition of HIF-1α, NF-κB, glucose transporters, and glycolytic enzymes also decreased glucose uptake and ATP production in pancreatic cancer cells (15). In breast cancer cells, EGFR expression was downregulated (16) and free-radical scavenging occurred (30). In colon and in lung cancer cell lines, G1 cell-cycle arrest occurred by upregulating Bax and downregulating Bcl-2 proteins (12) (13).
In vitro, graviola alkaloids caused movement disorders and myeloneuropathy with symptoms mimicking Parkinson’s disease (20) (21). Animal studies suggest that long-term ingestion of graviola juice promotes generation of reactive nitrogen species that may accelerate development of neurodegenerative diseases involving the microtubule-associated protein tau (34).",Leaf,Guanabana | Soursop | Custard apple | Brazilian paw paw,Annona muricata,Graviola,Graviola,

It is the most studied of all I3C metabolites and is thought to be superior to IC3 as a chemoprotective against breast and prostate cancers .Preclinical studies suggest DIM has anti-inflammatory , antiproliferative and chemopreventive effects and may also help increase bone mass .Limited human data indicate daily supplementation with DIM may benefit patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer by inhibiting the androgen receptor , but studies are mixed on whether it exerts positive effects in women with cervical cell abnormalities . Small studies suggest DIM may lead to changes in estrogen metabolism in premenopausal , and postmenopausal women with a history of early stage breast cancer . In an RCT of estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer patients taking tamoxifen, daily DIM promoted an increase in the metabolite ratio of 2-hydroxyestrone (2-OHE1, anti-tumorigenic) to 16α-hydroxyestrone (16α-OHE1, pro-tumorigenic) . However, this increase was coupled with a reduction in metabolites from tamoxifen. More research is needed to elucidate the pharmacokinetics and clinical efficacy of tamoxifen when taken with DIM.",,"In preclinical models, DIM induced apoptosis in pancreatic cancer cells (6) and enhanced effects of erlotinib (7).

DSI001310,Sambucus nigra subsp. canadensis,C0331057,"Elderberry belongs to a family of flowering shrubs known as Sambucus or Elder. They are native to Europe but have become naturalized in many parts of the world including the United States. Cultivated for medicinal and food purposes, the fruit is used to produce jams, syrups, and wine. Elderberry flowers and fruit are incorporated in remedies to reduce cold and flu symptoms, for inflammation and respiratory diseases , and to relieve constipation . The berries are a rich source of anthocyanins and other phenolics and nutrients . Several species of Sambucus produce elderberries with similar chemical compositions including American Elder (Sambucus canadensis) and Blue Elder (Sambucus caerulea) , but European Elder (Sambucus nigra) is the type most studied and used in supplements. In vitro studies demonstrate that elderberries possess antiviral , antibacterial , antidiabetic , immunomodulatory , antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and chemopreventive properties , although inhibition of cancer cell growth was shown to be weak . Flavonoids and proanthocyanidins were shown to block HIV1 infection, and may have additive effects with existing AIDS drugs such as enfuvirtide . Elderberry also conferred protective effects against oxidative stressors in endothelial cells . However, it did not demonstrate vasoprotective effects , and randomized trials found it ineffective in improving cardiovascular disease biomarkers or for improving cholesterol levels . Small studies found elderberry to be safe and effective in a preparation for chronic constipation and in reducing episodes of tonsillitis in children . It may also help reduce symptoms of influenza , but larger studies are needed to confirm these findings . Unsubstantiated claims that elderberry prevents or treats various diseases including AIDS, diabetes, flu and COVID-19 have been halted by the FDA. This is particularly important as patients may forego or avoid legitimate treatments.",,"Elderberry inhibits H1N1 activities by binding to H1N1 virions as well as by blocking host cell recognition and entry (5). It may also prevent HIV1 infection by binding to viral glycoproteins such as gp120 (10), but additional investigations are required to clarify those mechanisms (3). Elderberry’s anti-inflammatory effects may result from increased cytokine production (19) or inhibition of nuclear transcription factor kappaB and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (20). An elderberry extract improved metabolic disturbances in a murine model of obesity by lowering serum triglycerides, inflammatory markers and insulin resistance (30). Its antidiabetic properties occur via activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma and stimulation of insulin-dependent glucose uptake (6). Elderberry may also influence HDL dysfunction associated with chronic inflammation by affecting hepatic gene expression in hyperlipidemic mice (31). Another study indicates its chemopreventive potential is related to induction of quinone reductase as well as cyclooxygenase-2 and ornithine decarboxylase inhibition (2).",Fruit | Berry extract,Elder | elderberry | European elderberry; black elder; black elderberry | sambucus,Sambucus nigra subsp. canadensis | Sambucus canadensis,Elderberry (unspecified),Elderberry,

DSI001312,Garcinia mangostana,C0950008,"Mangosteen is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. The fruits are consumed as food and also used in traditional medicine to treat skin infections, wounds, and diarrhea. Mangosteen juice is marketed as a health drink and the pericarp, or fruit hull, is used in dietary supplements for its antioxidant activity. Preliminary data show that xanthones, bioactive compounds in mangosteen, exhibit antibacterial , antifungal , anti-inflammatory , antiatherosclerotic , anti-asthmatic , antiangiogenic , cytotoxic , aromatase-inhibitory , and anticancer properties. They may also provide protection against doxorubicin-induced neurotoxicity and cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity . Small studies suggest benefits of mangosteen-containing products as adjuncts in periodontal treatment , controlling halitosis , and in the treatment of chronic periodontitis . Mangosteen extracts were also found useful for weight management and for improving insulin sensitivity , but ineffective in alleviating exercise-induced fatigue or for treating schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder . Topical use of a mangosteen extract improved mild-moderate acne . Confirmatory studies are needed.",,"Many compounds isolated from mangosteen fruit and pericarp have been evaluated in lab studies. Xanthones alpha- and beta-mangostins, and garcinone B exhibit strong inhibitory effects against Mycobacterium tuberculosis  (3), as well as aromatase-inhibitor activity (14). Alpha- and gamma-mangostins act as histamine and serotonin receptor blockers (8) and inhibit HIV-1 protease (9). In animal models, they reduced major features of allergic asthma including airway inflammatory cell recruitment and hyperresponsiveness, increased Th2 cytokine levels, and attenuated increases in phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) activity, phosphorylation of Akt, and NF-kappaB (26). The ability of alpha-mangostin to inhibit fatty acid synthase may occur via stronger action on the ketoacyl synthase domain and weaker effects on the acetyl/malonyl transferase domain (22). It also reduced prostaglandin synthesis by inhibiting COX-1 and -2 enzyme activities (5), and prevented oxidative damage of LDL by functioning as a free-radical scavenger (7). The compound isogarcinol isolated from mangosteen induces anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressant effects in animal models (30) (31). Mangosteen extract may have antiobesity effects by increasing AMP-activated protein kinase and Sirtuin 1 activities in the liver (42).
Chemopreventive properties of mangosteen xanthones against specific human cancer cell lines have also been demonstrated, including: alpha-mangostin in leukemia (1) (6) (32), breast (33) (34), gastric (35), and pancreatic cancer cells (36) (37); gartanin in urinary bladder cancer (38); and gamma-mangostin (39) and garcinone E (10) in liver cancer cells. Extracts from the pericarp of mangosteen also exhibit antioxidant (13), antiproliferative, and apoptotic effects (11).
The preventive effect of alpha-mangostin on cisplatin-induced apoptotic death is associated with the inhibition of p53 expression and generation of reactive oxygen species (23). Alpha-mangostin inhibited growth of leukemia HL60 cells by inducing caspase-3-dependent apoptosis (1) (6). It reduced matrix metalloproteinase MMP-2 and -9 expression, increased E-cadherin expression, and suppressed the ERK signaling pathway in pancreatic cancer cell lines (36). In chronic myeloid leukemia cells, it induced autophagy via increased expression of the autophagosome marker LC-3II and accumulation of autophagic vacuoles, in addition to antiproliferative and apoptotic effects (32). Another study also attributes the antitumor activity of alpha-mangostin to autophagy and not endoplasmic reticulum stress induction (24).
Beta-mangostin decreased the proliferation of human cervical cancer HeLa cell by inhibiting cellular polymerases (43). Gamma-Mangostin demonstrated free radical scavenging activity in human liver cancer cells (39). In bladder cancer cell lines, activities of gartanin suggest mTOR pathway inhibition, downregulation of Bcl-2 expression, and p53 pathway activation leading to apoptotic induction (38).",Fruit,Mangostan | Mangostanier | Mangostao | Mangostier | Manguita | Meseter | Queen of Fruits,Garcinia mangostana,Mangosteen,Mangosteen,

DSI001336,Lobelia,C1095900,"Derived from the aerial parts of the plant, patients use lobelia for smoking cessation and to treat asthma and depression. Piperidine alkaloids are thought responsible for lobelia’s activity. In vitro and animal studies show that lobeline, a major constituent, crosses the blood-brain barrier, has activity similar to that of nicotine, and stimulates the release of dopamine and norepinephrine . At low doses lobelia has stimulant effects, but higher doses result in CNS depression . Murine studies suggest lobeline may produce anticonvulsant , neuroprotective , and antidepressive effects . Other preclinical studies suggest it may improve withdrawal-induced depression , enhance the effects of other antidepressants , and reduce alcohol consumption . In other experiments, lobeline improved acute lung injury and reversed multidrug resistance of tumor cells to doxorubicin . Limited studies have been conducted in humans. In a small proof-of-concept study in adults with ADHD, lobeline had modest improvements in working memory but not in attention . Clinical studies of lobelia do not support its use for smoking cessation .",,"Lobelia has central stimulant activity, dilates bronchioles, and increases respiration rate at low doses, but higher doses cause CNS and respiratory depression (10). Lobeline, a major alkaloid constituent, is a nicotinic acetylcholine receptor ligand (24).
In vitro, lobeline redistributes dopamine pools in presynaptic vesicles and antagonizes their release following amphetamine stimulation. Lobeline can have both antagonistic and synergistic effects when combined with nicotine and does not induce receptor upregulation as seen with nicotine (10).
In rodent models, lobeline increases dopamine release from striatal synaptosomes, increases norepinephrine release from the hippocampus (5), and binds extensively to nicotinic receptors both centrally and peripherally (4). Other animal studies suggest that beta-amyrin palmitate stimulates release of norepinephrine in the brain, possibly leading to an antidepressant effect (1). Murine studies suggest attenuation of withdrawal-induced depressive behavior may occur by targeting brain nAChRs, serotonergic and noradrenergic neurotransmissions, and/or hippocampal cell proliferation (22) (23).
Intravenous administration of approximately 12 mcg/kg lobeline to healthy human subjects resulted in cough, apnea, prolonged inspiration and expiratory pause, the feeling of choking, and pressure in the throat and chest (9).",Lobelia inflata - herb top | Plante entière,Lobella | Asthma weed | Indian tobacco | Gagroot | Pukeweed | Vomit weed,Lobelia Inflata | Lobelia syphilitica,Lobelia,Lobelia,

DSI001441,5-htp,C0000578,"5-HTP or L-5-Hydroxytryptophan is a key intermediate in the biosynthesis of the neurotransmitters serotonin and melatonin. It is formed by hydroxylation of the amino acid L-tryptophan. 5-HTP is marketed as a dietary supplement for sleep, to improve mood and well-being, and to suppress appetite. Seeds from the African shrub Griffonia simplicifolia are a major source for these supplements due to their high 5-HTP content . In animal models, anxiolytic and antidyskinetic effects have been demonstrated . 5-HTP has also been shown to restore serotonin levels or, at excessive levels, to induce serotonin syndrome . In humans, most research on 5-HTP involves small trials with mixed results. A few studies suggest 5-HTP may reduce anxiety or depression , but not treatment-resistant depression . Evidence for its use in PTSD prevention is also lacking . Other studies suggest antidepressant effects comparable with fluoxetine , and potential benefit as part of augmentation therapy for drug-resistant depression . 5-HTP has also been evaluated for obesity. Preliminary findings suggest it may help decrease food intake and increase weight loss and early satiety . More recently, a sublingual 5-HTP spray increased appetite control in overweight women . Other preliminary studies suggest benefit for patients with fibromyalgia , but not for postmenopausal hot flashes or tardive dyskinesia . 5-HTP does not appear to reduce chronic tension headaches, although a decrease in analgesic use was noted . It was also ineffective as prophylaxis for childhood migraine , but may improve pediatric sleep terrors . Larger well-designed studies are needed to determine the populations and conditions for which 5-HTP supplementation may be useful, and to determine safety, particularly in conjunction with other serotonergic medications including antidepressants.",,"5-HTP crosses the blood-brain barrier and increases serotonin synthesis (25). The advantage of 5-HTP over L-tryptophan is its ability to bypass the rate-limiting step that tryptophan must undergo via the enzyme tryptophan hydroxylase to convert to 5-HTP. In addition, this enzyme can be inhibited by various factors including B6 or magnesium deficiencies, stress, or insulin resistance, and make tryptophan unavailable for serotonin production (2).
In a series of preclinical experiments, 5-HTP was metabolized by a wide variety of gut bacteria and converted to 5-hydroxyindole, which can accelerate GI motility, but this conversion depends upon microbial composition and pH (39).
Relaxation and anxiolytic properties of 5-HTP are attributed to its ability to elevate CNS serotonin levels (2). 5-HTP was shown to augment neuroendocrine response to an SSRI via increased presynaptic 5HT availability, thus enhancing 5HT release into the synapse (26). It was also proposed to potentially reduce hot flashes in menopausal women with breast cancer or with risk of breast cancer by enhancing serotonin levels (27) , but a clinical study in postmenopausal women found it ineffective (20) .
5-HTP can also increase levels of melatonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine (28) (29), compounds involved in mood and sleep regulation and whose mechanistic pathways may also be stimulated (2). As abnormalities in serotonin and epinephrine pathways have been suspected in fibromyalgia and other chronic diseases (5) (30), this may help to explain preliminary benefits seen with 5-HTP supplementation in other disease states.
Additional studies are needed to further identify mechanisms and conditions under which 5-HTP may exert positive effects or pose concerns when used, especially with other medications due to its modulatory effects on neurotransmitters.","Griffonia simplicifolia, Seed | Griffonia simplicifolia, Seed | Dietary sources of L-tryptophan, which the body converts to 5-HTP, include turkey, chicken, pumpkin seeds, spinach, milk, and bananas.",5-Hydroxytryptophan | 5-HTP; L-5-Hydroxytryptophan | L-5-HTP; Oxitriptan (INN) | 5-OHTrp,5-HTP | 5-Hydroxytryptophan | 5-hydroxytryptophan,5-HTP,5-HTP,

DSI001468,Red Clover,C0330783,"Red clover is a perennial herb traditionally used to treat skin disorders such as psoriasis and eczema, whooping cough, and mastitis. It contains compounds known as isoflavones that act as phytoestrogens. An isoflavone extract is widely promoted as a dietary supplement to relieve menopausal symptoms. Preclinical studies suggest red clover extract may act as an estrogen agonist and stimulate proliferation of ER-positive breast cancer cells . However, the isoflavone Biochinin A inhibited aromatase activity and expression and may therefore confer a protective effect. Isoflavone-enriched extracts have shown neuroprotective effects in human cortical neurons and reduced skin aging in mice by increasing collagen . Clinical data show that supplementation with red clover isoflavones improves menopausal symptoms compared with placebo , but systematic reviews are mixed . In postmenopausal women, supplementation alleviated vasomotor and menopausal symptoms . A meta-analysis of a standardized extract suggests potential reductions in total cholesterol in peri- and postmenopausal women, but studies were heterogeneous . Isoflavones may also improve bone loss . In a trial involving osteopenic postmenopausal women, a red clover extract rich in isoflavones, aglycones, and probiotics attenuated bone mineral density loss caused by estrogen deficiency and improved bone turnover . Of concern are findings that red clover inhibits the growth of normal prostate cells and increases resistance of prostate cancer cells to high-dose radiation in vitro . Patients should consult with their physicians before taking red clover supplements.",,"Formononetin, an isoflavone, induced apoptosis in human breast cancer cells by activating the Ras-p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase in ER-positive breast cancer cells (23). It also inhibited proliferation of human osteosarcoma U2SO cells by decreasing expression of miR-375 and Bcl-2, an apoptotic repressor, while increasing Bax, a pro-apoptotic protein  (27). The isoflavone Biochanin A inhibited activity and gene expression of aromatase, an enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of androgen to estrogen (2). In addition, it protected dopaminergic neurons against lipopolysaccharide-induced damage by inhibiting microglial activation and proinflammatory factors (3). An isoflavone-enriched fraction showed neuroprotective activity in human cortical neurons as well, possibly due to antioxidant and estrogenic effects (4).
In a murine model, red clover isoflavones reduced skin aging induced by estrogen deprivation following ovariectomy (5).",Trifolium pratense- Flower | Flower,Cow clover | Wild clover | Purple clover beebread | Cow grass | Meadow clover | Purple clover,Red Clover Isoflavone Extract | Red clover,Red Clover,Red Clover,

DSI001474,Blainvillea acmella,C3578352,"Spilanthes acmella is an herbaceous plant that belongs to the family Asteraceae. It is used in traditional medicine throughout Asia and South America, where it is known as Jambu. The leaves are used for culinary purposes, and the flowers have been used for their numbing and pain-relieving properties, earning the plant such common names as the toothache plant. In addition, it has been noted to relieve stomatitis, have taste-activating properties, and to induce a salivary response. In vitro and animal studies suggest that Spilanthes, related species, and their compounds have antimicrobial , antinociceptive , anti-inflammatory , gastroprotective , and taste-activating properties. Spilanthol and acmellonate, compounds derived from this plant, are associated with reduced toothache pain and increased saliva secretion . Other experimental studies suggest diuretic and aphrodisiac effects. In vitro, a hydroethanolic extract of S. acmella produced cytotoxic effects in tumor cell cytoskeletons . In murine models of 5-fluorouracil-induced intestinal mucositis, spilanthol from A. oleracea reduced inflammation . However, human data are lacking.",,"Antinociceptive effects have been attributed to anti-inflammatory properties (11) and engagement of opioid receptors (9). Compounds that induce tingling sensations associated with topical application or chewing of jambu include spilanthol, and to a lesser degree acmellonate (4). Taste-activating alkamide compounds that induce a salivary response have also been identified (4). Spilanthol is among the most active alkamides isolated from aerial parts of A. oleracea to demonstrate insecticidal (14) and acaricidal (15) activity.
In animal models, spilanthol isolated from S. acmella reduced inflammatory responses via NFk-B inactivation (6). Potential mechanisms for gastroprotective effects with rhamnogalacturonan, a polysaccharide isolated from A. oleracea, include protectively binding to the mucosal surface, increasing mucus synthesis, scavenging radicals, and diminishing secretions of acid and pepsin (12). Other research suggests rhamnogalacturonan promotes restoration of epithelial continuity via epithelial cell proliferation and enhances mucin production to promote gastric ulcer healing (13).
In vivo, potential teratogenic activity in embryos may be due to various spilanthol metabolites (21). An animal study found that an S. acmella ethanolic flower extract rich in alkylamides affected male sexual functioning by increasing levels of testosterone, follicle-stimulating hormone, and luteinizing hormone (5), with the effect being significant and lasting at high doses.",Whole plant,Jambu | Toothache plant | Electric daisy | Paracress | Buzz buttons | Schezuan buttons,Blainvillea acmella,,Spilanthes acmella,

It is available in the form of supplements, but these are not absorbed following oral administration . There are no data to support claims of improved health or anti-aging benefit with SOD supplementation. Animal studies suggest that oral administration of a standardized SOD extract combined with wheat gliadin may protect against oxidative stress-induced cell death and impaired cognitive function . However, there is no supporting literature on the benefits of sublingual SOD. The parenteral formulation, Orgotein, is classified by the FDA as an orphan drug, not as a dietary supplement, for the treatment of familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Studies of possible effects of Orgotein in treating radiation-induced cystitis have yielded mixed results . A topical SOD formulation did not significantly improve postradiation fibrosis .",,"The enzyme superoxide dismutase (SOD) catalyzes the breakdown of superoxide radicals that are toxic to living cells into harmless components consisting of oxygen and hydrogen peroxide (2), but because SOD1 also protects cancer cells and is overexpressed in lung cancer cells, it was identified as a therapeutic target for anti-lung cancer compounds (10).

DSI001541,Alfalfa,C2349204,"The leaves and seeds of this widely used food crop are thought to have diuretic properties, to be effective against diabetes, thyroid gland malfunction, arthritis, high cholesterol, and peptic ulcers , and to promote menstruation and lactation . Alfalfa is a popular treatment for asthma and hay fever . It is also claimed to be a source of vitamins A, C, E, and K and of the minerals, calcium, potassium, phosphorus, and iron . Alfalfa sprout extracts showed neuroprotective and estrogenic activities in preclinical studies. It was found to lower cholesterol levels in small uncontrolled trials . L-canavanine, a toxic amino acid present in alfalfa seeds, was shown to affect T cells . Whether high enough concentrations of this substance are obtained through supplementation is not clear . In another study, rats that were fed alfalfa were more susceptible to colon cancer, although such effects have not been observed in humans . Ingestion of contaminated alfalfa sprouts and seeds resulted in fatalities and salmonellosis . Listeriosis has also been reported following consumption of contaminated alfalfa tablets .",,"Saponins contained in alfalfa act on the cardiovascular, nervous, and digestive systems (1). The hypocholesterolemic and hemolytic activity of the leaves and sprouts of alfalfa are attributed to a steroidal saponin fraction which, along with fiber contained within the plant, binds to cholesterol in vitro. Alkaloids such as stachydrine and l-homo-stachydrine found in the seed are thought responsible for alfalfa’s ability to promote menstrual discharge and for its lactogenic activity (2). Biochanin-A, an isoflavonoid constituent, blocks NF-κB activation by preventing phosphorylation and degradation of IκBα, leading to decreased expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase, thus preventing proliferation and inflammation (17).
Extracts from alfalfa preferentially served as agonists for estrogen receptor beta, and alfalfa increased estrogen-dependent MCF-7 breast cancer cell proliferation even more than did estradiol (9). The non-protein amino acid constituent, L-canavanine, constitutes 1.5% of the dry weight of alfalfa seeds and alfalfa sprouts. It has been shown to affect human T cells in vitro and induce hematologic and serologic abnormalities characteristic of systemic lupus erythematosus in monkeys (13). This is the proposed mechanism by which systemic lupus erythematosus relapse occurs in humans as well (7), although some researchers question whether L-canavanine concentrations in alfalfa are sufficient to cause this effect (8).",Medicago sativa - Herb top | Whole plant | Alfalfa seeds and sprouts are available around the world and used frequently as animal feed.,Buffalo Herb | Lucerne | Purple Medick | Purple Medicle | Purple Medic,Alfalfa protein concentrate | Alfalfa,Alfalfa | Alfalfa Protein,Alfalfa,

In vitro studies indicate that it has anti-inflammatory effects , and can prevent ethanol-induced cytotoxicity . Other preclinical studies suggest antioxidant , neuroprotective , and anti-asthmatic effects . Some isolated compounds like aspacochioside C and a few spirostanol saponins exhibit moderate cytotoxicity , and the compound methylprotodioscin downregulated proinflammatory cytokine production . However, Chinese asparagus or these constituents have not been studied in humans as a treatment for cancer. Chinese asparagus induced CYP2E1 and 1A2 in animal studies, suggesting potential interactions with drugs metabolized by these enzymes . Clinical relevance has yet to be determined.",,"Compounds isolated from this species include norlignans (15), steroidal saponins (16), pregnane glycosides, aspacochinosides, and furostanol glycosides, some of which may have anti-neuroinflammatory effects in lipopolysaccharide-induced murine microglial cells via inhibition of nitric oxide production (11). An aqueous extract of asparagus root inhibits tumor necrosis factor-alpha secretion in mouse astrocytes (4). Asparagus root also reduces alcohol-induced hepatotoxicity in Hep G2 cell lines (3).
In vitro and murine models of lung inflammation suggest that methylprotodioscin is the active constituent that protects against airway inflammation (10) (13). Dioscin and methylprotodioscin suppressed airway mucin gene expression and production by acting directly on airway epithelial cells (10). Methylprotodioscin inhibited production of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, TNF-alpha, and IL-1beta in lung tissue (13), and downregulated proinflammatory cytokine production via c-Jun N-terminal kinase/c-Jun pathway inhibition in lung cancer cells (13).",Asparagus officinalis - Shoot,Tian Dong; Tian Men Dong | Radix asparagi | Tenmondo | Asparagus root,Asparagus Officinalis,Asparagus | Chinese Asparagus,Chinese Asparagus,

Sulforaphane is a sulfur-rich compound known to benefit human health. Consumption of broccoli sprouts was found to help reduce Helicobacter pylori-induced gastritis , but not effective in eradicating Helicobacter pylori infection , and a sulforaphane combined with standard triple therapy (proton pump inhibitor, clarithromycin, and amoxicillin) neither improved the eradication rate nor reduced the occurrence of adverse events . Additional studies reported intake of sprouts to protect against oxidative stress-induced upper airway disease and DNA damage , and long-term consumption to reduce levels of inflammatory markers in overweight subjects . Supplementation with sprouts also enhanced antiviral responses , and glucoraphanin as well as a broccoli sprout beverage may aid the excretion of environmental pollutants. In oncology settings, sulforaphane demonstrated anticancer effects against prostate , breast , and urinary cancer cells , and may protect the skin from ultraviolet radiation . In murine models, a prenatal/maternal broccoli sprouts diet appeared to offer greater preventive effects on breast cancer development compared with postnatal early-life treatment . In patients with prior melanoma, a broccoli sprout extract was found to be well tolerated . A feasibility study involving advanced pancreatic cancer patients found some benefits with broccoli sprout supplementation but noted difficulty in capsule intake by some participants, and to be associated with increased digestive symptoms . In addition, a broccoli sprout extract was found to affect changes in gene expression, but not prostate cancer biomarkers in men undergoing prostate biopsy . Larger studies are needed to determine the chemopreventive potential of broccoli sprouts, but challenges include selection of the source, placebo, dose as well as standardization of the formulation of the intervention material .",,"Sulforaphane may block the initiation stage in carcinogenesis by inhibiting enzymes that convert procarcinogens to carcinogens and inducing phase 2 enzymes that metabolize carcinogens to facilitate excretion. Induction of phase 2 enzymes occurs through antioxidant response element-driven gene expression, with targets including NAD(P)H:quinone reductase, heme oxygenase 1, and gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase regulated by nuclear factor E2 related factor (13). Sulforaphane also suppresses cancer development through various molecular targets. It induces G2/M cell cycle arrest via cyclin-dependent kinases and triggers dose-dependent apoptosis and inhibits histone deacetylase by its metabolites in vitro (13). In a triple-negative breast cancer animal model, sulforaphane protection against cancer stem-like cell proliferation was attributed to suppression of the Cripto-mediated pathway and/or the Cripto/Alk4 protein complex (16).
In a small human study, broccoli sprout homogenates enhanced antiviral defense responses via peripheral blood NK cell activation and increased granzyme B production (14).",Red cabbage - Leaves,"

DSI001727,Phellinus linteus,,"Phellinus linteus (PL) is a yellow, bitter-tasting mushroom that grows on mulberry trees. It is used in traditional medicine in Asia where it is often mixed with other medicinal mushrooms such as reishi and maitake, and promoted as an adjunctive treatment during cancer therapy. It also has traditional applications in the treatment of hemorrhage, hemostasis, and menstrual disorders . Preclinical studies have identified polysaccharide-protein complexes in PL that may have immunomodulating effects . In animal models, the polyphenolic constituent demonstrated anti-inflammatory properties, which may protect against injury and other syndromes involving infarcts, hematomas, or hemorrhages . Other constituents such as interfungin A may help prevent protein modification in hyperglycemic states . PL extracts have exhibited a variety of properties in human cancer cell lines . In vitro and animal studies suggest antiangiogenic and antioxidant effects . Antiproliferative effects against breast , colon , liver , lung , oral , prostate , and skin cancers have also been reported. In addition, PL and its constituents have exhibited chemosensitizing effects in pancreatic and colon cancer cells . Studies in humans are very limited. Preliminary data in pancreatic cancer patients suggest PL may improve outcomes in part by improving adherence to adjuvant chemotherapy . There are also a few case reports of tumor regression following consumption of PL . However, well-designed trials are needed to confirm these effects.",,"Polysaccharide-protein complexes found in PL have immunomodulating (1), antiangiogenic, and antioxidant properties (5). Furopyranone compounds in PL that inhibit protein glycation may have applications in preventing or treating diabetic complications (4) (23). In non-obese diabetic mice, a PL-polysaccharide extract enhanced function of macrophages, as well as dendritic, NK, T, and B cells, and prevented inflammation by inhibiting IFNγ, IL2, and TNFα via TH1 cells and macrophages. It also upregulated IL4 expression in TH2 cells (23).
Anti-inflammatory activities of inotilone isolated from PL might be due to reduced levels of malondialdehyde, inducible NO synthase, COX2, NFκB, and MMP9, as well as increased activities of catalase, superoxide dismutase, and glutathione peroxidase via TNFα and NO suppression (25).
The phenolic compound hispidin protected against cytotoxicity, DNA damage, and hydroxyl radical formation (26).
PL inhibited proliferation in human colon cancer cells via decreased Bcl2 and cyclin B1 and increased cytochrome C (9). Another study similarly found a PL extract induced G0/G1 arrest and apoptosis in human colon carcinoma cells via p21 upregulation, cyclin D1 and Bcl2 downregulation, release of cytochrome C, and activation of caspases 9, 3, and 8 (10). Decreased cyclin-dependent kinases CDK2, 4, and 6, and dose-dependent apoptosis of lung cancer cells after treatment with PL were also observed (12).",Mycelia,Meshimakobu | Meshima | Song gen | Sanghuang,Phellinus linteus,Phellinus linteus,Phellinus linteus,

DSI001859,carnitine,C0007258,"Carnitine is a nutrient that plays an important role in fatty acid absorption and mitochondrial function. It is synthesized endogenously from lysine and methionine and is also found in meat and dairy products. Deficiencies can be caused by genetic disorders, malnutrition, malabsorption and kidney dialysis, and affect the heart, skeletal muscles, liver, nerve, and endocrine functions. Carnitine supplements are used to enhance physical performance and to treat fatigue, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, obesity, chronic fatigue syndrome, liver disorders, and cancer. A meta-analysis determined that supplementation improves body weight and BMI in overweight and obese individuals . It also alleviated muscle damage in resistance trained and untrained groups , muscle wasting in patients with pemphigus vulgaris , and prevented cardiovascular disease in hemodialysis patients . Long-term supplementation has been correlated with improved myocardial mechanical performance, reduction in ventricular arrhythmias and increased exercise tolerance , and higher levels of carnitine were associated with lower risks of cardiovascular events and recurrent stroke after ischemic stroke . Carnitine also improved oxidative and inflammatory markers in patients with cardiovascular disease , but did not reduce risk of death or heart failure in patients with anterior acute myocardial infarction . In critically-ill patients, supplements improved nutritional status indicators, which have a key role in prognosis of diseases and adjunctive use improved symptoms of autism spectrum disorder in children and adolescents . Preliminary findings also suggest improvement in symptoms of chronic fatigue syndrome and physical performance in patients undergoing dialysis for end-stage renal disease , but data on benefits against fatigue associated with multiple sclerosis are inconclusive . Some trials reported enhanced physical performance , and improved aerobic capacity and exercise tolerance whereas others yielded mixed results . L-carnitine used by itself or in combination with clomiphene citrate may help treat idiopathic male infertility , although it did not improve sperm count or motility . An antioxidant formulation containing L-carnitine was also ineffective in improving semen parameters or DNA integrity . In women with polycystic ovary syndrome, supplementation may improve mental health parameters and biomarkers of oxidative stress . Small studies in oncology settings found supplementation to improve nutritional status and quality of life in pancreatic cancer patients , and to reduce vismodegib-associated muscle spasms . L-carnitine by itself or in combination with Coenzyme Q10 may also relieve chemotherapy-related fatigue, reduce fatigue in both younger hypothyroid patients receiving levothyroxine, and in thyroid cancer patients who have hypothyroidism, post-surgery . But it did not improve fatigue in patients with invasive malignancies . Confirmatory data are also needed to determine if chemo-induced carnitine insufficiency increases malaise or fatigue . In prostate cancer patients initiating androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), a low-carb diet reversed ADT-induced metabolic abnormalities which included reductions in acylcarnitine . Acetyl-L-carnitine, an ester derivative available as a supplement, is often used as a neuroprotective agent. It may help reduce diabetic neuropathy and improve cognition in patients with severe hepatic encephalopathy . In elderly patients with dysthymic disorder, it was found comparable to fluoxetine , but ineffective against Alzheimer’s disease .In cancer settings, acetyl-L-carnitine increased chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) , which persisted at the 2-year follow-up . Current guidelines do not recommend this supplement for preventing CIPN .",,"Carnitine is a non-essential amino acid, with only the L-isomer utilized in human bodies. It is available in many foods, and bioavailability from dietary sources is much higher (54%–87%) than from oral supplements (14%–18%) (48). L-carnitine plays a role in the transport of long chain fatty acids across the inner mitochondrial membrane, facilitating beta-oxidation of fatty acids and acting as an intracellular energy reservoir of acetyl groups. In deficiencies, these acyl esters accumulate and cause deleterious effects including inhibition of adenine nucleotide translocase, which impedes ATP production (5). Carnitine supplementation prevents oxidative stress and ameliorates mitochondrial function (29). L-carnitine may protect against statin-induced cellular damage via antioxidative properties in rat hepatocytes (31).
Animal studies show L-carnitine has cardioprotective effects by preventing skeletal muscle myopathy (14) and may improve myocardial metabolic patterns, reduce necrosis, diminish enzymatic infarct size, and preserve left ventricular function (8). Effects on congestive heart failure-associated myopathy may be due to caspase inhibition and decreased TNF-alpha levels (14). Metabolism of dietary L-carnitine by intestinal microbiota produced trimethylamine-N-oxide, a proatherogenic species, which accelerated atherosclerosis (30). Anticatabolic effects may occur by improving nitrogen balance either via increased protein synthesis or reduced protein degradation. Other studies show it prevents oxidative stress and ameliorates mitochondrial function (29). Carnitine is often proposed for the treatment of obesity and metabolic syndrome. Possible mechanisms include inhibition of stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 activity, β-oxidation of fatty acids, and increased storage in the body tissues (49). It may help cancer-related cachexia by reducing proteasome activity (50), but studies in humans are needed.
In one clinical trial, carnitine reversed hyperthyroidism by acting as a peripheral antagonist of thyroid hormone action (3). In hemodialysis patients, carnitine has anti-inflammatory and anticoagulation effects which may contribute to its cardioprotective activity (24).","Meat, dairy products, beans, avocado",Vitamin BT | Vitamin B7 | ALCAR,L-tartrate de carnitine ,Carnitine Silicate | Carnitine | Carnitine Orotate,Carnitine,

DSI001876,Aspalathus linearis,C1074162,"Prepared from the dried leaves of the rooibos plant native to South Africa, rooibos tea has grown popular in western countries because it is low in caffeine and rich in antioxidants, especially the polyphenols aspalathin and nothofagin . It does not contain any catechins, the major flavonoids present in green and black teas . In vitro and animal studies have shown that rooibos can modulate immune function , exhibit anti-inflammatory effects , and prevent oxidative stress . Animal studies suggest that it may prevent chromosomal aberrations and tumor mutagenesis . In other lab studies, topically applied rooibos protected against microsomal lipid peroxidation and reduced tumor formation , and a rooibos tea extract appeared to protect against radiation damage . However, these effects have not been confirmed in humans. Preliminary data suggests rooibos may inhibit angiotensin-converting enzyme in healthy volunteers , which may benefit cardiovascular health. However, studies in humans are very limited and further research is needed. Rat studies suggest that prolonged exposure to rooibos may affect the reproductive system, impair fertility, or affect liver and kidney function . In humans, a few cases of liver toxicity with long-term use or ingesting large amounts have been reported. Because compounds isolated from rooibos leaves demonstrated estrogenic activity , patients with hormone-sensitive cancers should use caution before taking rooibos.",,"Rooibos was shown to enhance the activity of glutathione-S transferase and UDP-glucuronosyl transferase in rat livers  (11) (16), allowing cells to protect against oxidative stress, and to reduce the effects of hepatocarcinogens. A study of oxidative stress in rats found that serum superoxide dismutase and urine 8-hydroxy-2’-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) concentrations (as markers for DNA damage) were significantly reduced following administration of rooibos (17). Some studies have shown that the non-oxidized teas have greater antimutagenic effects compared to the oxidized forms. This is probably due to reduction in total polyphenol content with oxidization (11) (18) (19). The anti-inflammatory effects of rooibos are thought to be due to its inhibition of COX-2 enzyme (5).
Rooibos also modulates immune function: It induces higher IL6, IL10 and IFN-gamma levels and increases cell-mediated immunity (3); and increases IL2 levels while suppressing IL4 (4).
In other studies, rooibos significantly decreased glucocorticoid levels in rats and steroid metabolite ratios linked to metabolic disorders-cortisol:cortisone in humans and CORT:testosterone in rats (23). Hot water-soluble solids from fermented rooibos inhibited adipogenesis and influenced adipocyte metabolism, suggesting a role in preventing obesity (24).",Leaf,Redbush tea (South Africa) | Rooibosch (Netherlands),Aspalathus linearis,Rooibos,Rooibos Tea,

Its bark has been used for thousands of years in China and Europe as a remedy for fevers and pain. Aspirin is derived from salicin, an active compound in willow bark. In vitro, willow bark extracts and salicin have exhibited anti-inflammatory and anticancer effects , but data in humans are limited. A few studies suggest that willow bark may help manage back pain , but studies of osteoarthritis are mixed with negative findings for rheumatoid arthritis . Aspirin has been studied for the prevention of cardiovascular diseases as well as cancer . However, willow bark should not be used as a substitute for aspirin because of the variation in its potency. Children should not be given willow bark because of the potential for developing Reye syndrome, a serious condition associated with the use of aspirin .",,"Although anti-inflammatory activity is mostly attributed to salicin (13), the main bioactive compound in willow bark, catechol and flavonoid compounds have also been found to be responsible (12). Willow bark inhibits pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-alpha and COX-2, and nuclear translocation of the transcription factor NF-κB (1). It was also found to significantly raise low glutathione levels, thereby limiting lipid peroxidation (14).
Antiproliferative effects in human colon and lung cancer cells are due to growth inhibition and apoptotic induction (15). In vitro and animal models suggest that salicin can inhibit ROS and ERK signaling pathways to produce antiangiogenic effects (4).",Salix alba - young twigs bark | Bark | Bark,Bay willow | Black willow | White willow,Willow Bark | Salix helix | Salix spp.,Willow Bark,Willow Bark,

DSI001908,Melatonin,C1527137,"Melatonin is produced endogenously in humans by the pineal gland. Although the exact mechanism of action is unknown, it is thought to control the circadian pacemaker and promote sleep . Small amounts of melatonin are found in fruits, nuts, olive oil, and wine. The supplemental form is used as a sleep-aid. Melatonin may decrease sleep latency and improve sleep duration , although randomized trials have produced mixed data . Meta analyses did not find any significant effects with melatonin on insomnia disorder , secondary sleep disorders associated with medical, neurological, or substance abuse disorders , or on sleep quality in menopausal women , but supplementation improved subjective sleep quality in patients with traumatic brain injury and Parkinson’s disease , and cognitive outcomes in patients with Alzheimer’s disease . Melatonin may also benefit those with jet lag .Melatonin was shown to decrease surgery-associated anxiety and pain , frequency of migraine attacks and perioperative anxiety , but there is insufficient evidence for its use to improve delirium in hospitalized patients , to improve depression or depressive symptoms , or for seasonal affective disorder (SAD) . Studies in patients with nocturia and those in ICU produced mixed results . Whether it can help in benzodiazepine withdrawal is also unclear . Data suggest benefits of child-appropriate, prolonged-release melatonin for long-term treatment in children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorder and insomnia . The American Academy of Neurology guidelines recommend using melatonin, starting with a low-dose, for children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorder and sleep disturbance if behavioral strategies have not been helpful, and if contributing coexisting conditions and use of concomitant medications have been addressed . Clinical trials evaluating melatonin as a monotherapy or in combination with other agents, and in patients with solid tumors reported improvements in fatigue , and quality of life and survival time but a systematic review reported no such benefits . Melatonin also did not improve appetite, weight, or quality of life in cancer patients with cachexia . In studies of postmenopausal breast cancer survivors, short-term supplementation did not influence estradiol levels but improved sleep quality . Data also suggest melatonin may help reduce incidence of chemotherapy side effects including thrombocytopenia, asthenia, and neurotoxicity ; improve cognitive function, sleep quality and depressive symptoms ; minimize radiotherapy-induced reduction in blood cell counts ; protect against radiation-induced genotoxicity ; and reduce the incidence of oral mucositis caused by chemo- and radiotherapy . In addition, melatonin was found comparable to zolpidem in affecting sleep duration, latency, efficiency, and disturbance in colorectal cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy . But in survivors of childhood cancers, there were no effects on sleep or neurocognitive performance . According to a case report, oral melatonin may delay menopause in pre-menopausal women by modulating levels of follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and estrogen .",,"Melatonin is an endogenously produced indolamine hormone secreted by the pineal gland in humans. Nocturnal secretion is regulated by circadian rhythms and nighttime darkness (17), and melatonin is thought to control the circadian pacemaker and promote sleep. Ironically, it is associated with wakefulness and activity in nocturnal animals (14). As levels of melatonin increase, an associated drop in core body temperature occurs. Both elderly and depressed patients tend to have lower basal levels of melatonin (2).
Melatonin is a free-radical scavenger (18) (38) and enhances antioxidative enzyme activities (39), interacting with cytosolic calmodulin and stimulating IL-4 production in bone marrow T-lymphocytes (1). In vitro and animal studies suggest that antitumor effects may occur through antimitotic or immunomodulatory activity. In vitro studies demonstrate antiproliferative effects on human breast cancer (HS578T) (19) and mouse melanoma (B16BL6, PG19) (8). Decreases in breast cancer metastasis may occur via modulation of Rho-associated kinase protein-1 expression (41). Melatonin reduces proliferation of PC-3 and LNCaP cells in mice, but has no effect on apoptosis (9). Its effect on tumor cell growth may be mediated in part by melatonin receptor signaling (20) (21). In endometrial cancer cells, it interferes with estrogen receptor expression (22). Other laboratory studies suggest that melatonin behaves both as a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) and as an aromatase inhibitor (42) (43). In a murine model, it modulated expression of genes crucial for DNA repair — Ogg1, Apex1, and Xrcc1 — in peripheral blood cells, to reduce X-ray-induced DNA damage (45).","Small amounts of melatonin are found in fruits, nuts, olive oil and wine.",MLT | Pineal hormone,Melatonin,Melatonin,Melatonin,

DSI001977,Cannabis,C0024808,"Cannabis sativa is an annual flowering herb native to East Asia, but is now cultivated around the world. Its uses as a source of industrial fiber, seed oil, and as a recreational agent date back thousands of years across cultures. It has also been employed in traditional medicine as an analgesic, hypnotic, and hallucinogenic, as a sedative, and for reducing inflammation. Preparations containing flowers (marijuana) and leaves; hashish derived from the resinous extract of the plant are consumed orally; by smoking in cigarettes, cigars, pipes, water pipes, or “blunts” (cannabis rolled in the tobacco-leaf wrapper from a cigar); or by vaporizing. Cannabis tinctures, teas, ointments, and oil-based extracts that can be mixed into food products are also popular. It is currently the most widely used illicit agent by more than 147 million people worldwide , and the common route of consumption is via inhalation. Because of the potential for high abuse and dependence, and its classification as a Schedule I agent by the Controlled Substances Act in 1970, cannabis use is a controversial subject in the US.Pharmacologic investigations over the last few decades revealed cannabinoids (terpenoids) to be the active constituents. Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) is the chief psychoactive component whereas cannabidiol (CBD) is a major secondary non-psychoactive cannabinoid, and may modulate the effects of THC. It has antipsychotic, anticonvulsive, and anxiolytic effects. When co-administered, CBD was reported to mitigate the adverse psychotropic and cardiovascular effects associated with THC .Cannabis has been studied for its utility in treating pain, symptoms of neurological disorders, AIDS and cancer.A systematic review reported significant relief from pain due to neuropathy, fibromyalgia, rheumatoid arthritis, and mixed chronic pain following cannabinoid use compared to placebo but another review determined placebo as a contributor to pain reductions . In addition, a 4-year prospective study involving 1,514 patients with chronic non-cancer pain did not find evidence that cannabis use decreased pain severity or interference, or exerted an opioid-sparing effect . In a Cochrane review of four trials involving 48 epileptic patients, short-term CBD use was reported to be well tolerated with no adverse effects, but limited evidence precluded definitive conclusions to be reached on efficacy . Newer randomized studies of patients with either Lennox-Gastaut syndrome or Dravet syndrome, both rare forms of epilepsy, reported effectiveness of Epidiolex, an oral CBD solution, for reducing the frequency of seizures . This is now an FDA-approved drug . Additionally, data indicate benefits of cannabinoids for treating spasticity and neuropathic pain in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients . The American Academy of Neurology issued a Summary of Systematic Reviews for Clinicians indicating that oral cannabis extract is effective in reducing patient-reported spasticity scores and central pain or painful spasms associated with MS .Conclusions from a large, comprehensive review of 79 trials (6462 subjects) indicate low-quality evidence to address weight gain from HIV infection, sleep disorders, increasing appetite, and for Tourette syndrome, along with elevated risk of short-term adverse effects . The evidence for recommending cannabinoids to treat symptoms of dyskinesia, Parkinson’s and Huntington’s diseases, irritable bowel syndrome, and addiction has been deemed unavailable or insufficient .In oncology settings, preclinical findings from 34 studies suggest selective cytotoxic effects of cannabinoids against glioma cells (sparing normal brain cells) via apoptosis, toxicity, autophagy and necrosis . A clinical study of 9 patients with recurrent glioblastoma multiforme receiving chemotherapy did not find any benefit with intratumoral THC, but it was well tolerated . Data from another study involving 21 glioblastoma patients, in which oromucosal whole plant extract nabiximols (contains THC +CBD) was used, have yet to be published . In addition, a cannabinoid resin extract was reported to affect dose-dependent disease control in a patient with acute lymphoblastic leukemia . But a retrospective observational study showed that concomitant use of cannabis during immunotherapy with nivolumab was associated with reduction in tumor response rate in patients with advanced melanoma, non-small-cell lung cancer, and renal clear cell carcinoma. Progression-free survival and overall survival remained unaffected .For symptom management, systematic reviews show that patients who used cannabis-based products experienced less chemo-induced nausea and vomiting compared to those on placebo group or on antiemetics. The differences were not statistically significant and adverse effects including “feeling high,” dizziness, sedation, and dysphoria were reported, resulting in a high dropout rate. Noteworthy are the 2017 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) guidelines on antiemetics that recommend dronabinol and nabilone for nausea and vomiting, which is resistant to standard therapy .Findings on effectiveness of cannabis against cancer pain are encouraging. Data from four trials indicate reductions in pain with orally administered THC and with nabiximols spray in advanced cancer patients . In addition, incorporating medical cannabis early in the treatment as opposed to delayed start resulted in decreased opioid use along with improved pain control in this population . Cannabis has also been investigated for its role in ameliorating cancer-related anorexia-cachexia syndrome (CACS), but neither cannabis extract nor THC were found useful in a randomized trial of patients with advanced cancer . Additional case reports suggest that dronabinol may be useful for managing persistent symptomatic paraneoplastic night sweats in cancer patients . In a randomized uncontrolled study, THC-containing medicinal cannabis was found to improve sleep, functional well-being, and quality of life in patients with high grade gliomas .Although some data suggest potential benefits, cannabis remains a contentious issue because non-medical use is associated with high risk of addiction, especially when used from an early age ; dependence ; adverse effects ; and with withdrawal syndrome (irritability, sleeping difficulties, dysphoria, craving, and anxiety) that makes cessation tough, eventually leading to relapse. Cannabis use was also reported to elevate the risk of creating false memories .It is also important to note that synthetic cannabinoid drugs cause more serious adverse effects compared to natural cannabis, and include respiratory difficulties, hypertension, tachycardia, chest pain, muscle twitches, acute renal failure, anxiety, agitation, psychosis, suicidal ideation and cognitive impairment .Some studies suggest utility of nicotine patch in decreasing negative affect-related withdrawal symptoms in individuals with cannabis use disorder ; and in patients with cannabis dependence, nabiximols combined with psychosocial interventions reduced cannabis use . However, an incentive-based intervention was ineffective in individuals with early psychosis and problematic cannabis use .Despite the controversy surrounding cannabis use, California became the first state to legalize it for “medical use” in 1996. As of May 2021, it is available in 35 more states and the District of Columbia (DC) as a medicinal agent, with 16 states and DC also allowing recreational use. Current indications that qualify for medical cannabis use include cancer symptoms, non-cancer pain, glaucoma, AIDS, epilepsy, and MS. However, cannabis use remains illegal under federal law. Following a review of available scientific evidence, the Institute of Medicine , and the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine recommend that further research be done to develop a comprehensive understanding of the health effects of cannabis , which can inform medical cannabis policy. Barriers to research include regulatory issues that involve the FDA, Drug Enforcement Administration, National Institute on Drug Abuse, and Institutional Review Boards; procuring cannabis for studies; and methodological challenges of establishing an acceptable route of administration and standardized doses .With the growing popularity of cannabis among cancer patients, it is important that oncology providers be aware of emerging data so they can counsel patients about its use . The consensus of an expert panel in supportive cancer care is that the evidence to recommend cannabinoids for the management of chemo-induced nausea and vomiting, nausea from advanced cancer, cancer-associated anorexia-cachexia, and taste disturbance is insufficient . The panel also recommends against the use of cannabinoids as an adjuvant analgesic for cancer pain . Additionally, a systematic review determined that rigorous evidence is lacking to inform the dosing, safety, and efficacy of cannabinoids in children with cancer .",,"Cannabinoids are the active constituents that mimic endogenous cannabinoids, and their activity is based on a receptor-mediated mechanism. THC exerts psychoactive and pain-relieving effects by acting as a partial agonist of cannabinoid receptors CB1 (predominantly expressed in the central nervous system) and CB2 (associated with the immune system). CB1 and CB2 are members of the G protein-coupled receptors (30), and are activated through inhibition of adenylate-cyclase. The activation in turn inhibits the release of neurotransmitters acetylcholine and glutamate, while indirectly affecting opioid and serotonin receptors, gamma-aminobutyric acid and N-methly-D-asparate (31). The antiemetic effect of nabilone is due to its ability to activate CB receptors in the brain, which mediate nausea and vomiting (32).Mechanisms by which CBD exerts its effects include activation of the serotonin receptor 5-HT1A (33); inhibition of reuptake and/or metabolism of anandamide, an endocannabinoid; activation of transient receptor potential vanilloid (TRPV1) channels; inhibition of adenosine reuptake; agonism of PPAR-gamma receptors; by intracellular increase in calcium ions; as well as via anti-oxidative activity (34).After inhalation of cannabis, THC is detectable in plasma within seconds, with peak plasma concentration achieved within 3-10 minutes. The bioavailability of THC varies and depends on the depth of inhalation, puff duration, and breath-hold. The systemic bioavailability is estimated to be ∼23-27% for heavy users; and 10-14% for occasional users. Following onset of smoking (cigarette containing 15.8 or 33.8 mg THC), the maximum THC plasma concentration (84.3 and 162.2 ng/mL) is attained at about 8 minutes and within 3-4 hours, falls rapidly to 1-4 ng/mL (35).When compared to smoking and inhalation, systemic absorption following oral ingestion was slower, with maximum plasma concentration (4.4-11 ng/mL for 20 mg; and 2.7-6.3 ng/mL for 15 mg) of THC attained in 1-2 hours.  Substantial metabolism in the liver, via microsomal hydroxylation and oxidation catalyzed by enzymes of cytochrome P450 complex, likely lowers oral bioavailability of THC by 4-12%.Much of the cannabis (80-90%) is excreted within 5 days in the form of hydroxylated and carboxylated metabolites (more than 65% of cannabis is excreted in the feces, with about 20% in urine). It is also important to note that residual THC levels have a half-life of 1.3 days in infrequent users compared to 5-13 days in frequent users (36).Data on cannabidiol indicate the half-life to be between 1.4 and 10.9 h following oromucosal spray; 2–5 days following chronic oral administration; 24 h following intravenous administration; and 31 h following smoking. Bioavailability after smoking was 31%, but has yet to be determined with other routes. The maximum concentration is reached much faster following smoking and inhalation compared to oral and oromucosal routes. The Tmax has been reported to be achieved between 0 and 4 h (37).",Seed(s),Marijuana | Ganja | Bhang | Weed | Pot | Grass | Dope | Reefer | Hash | (>1000 other terms),Cannabis Sativa seed,Cannabis,Cannabis,

DSI002051,Lessertia frutescens,C1013055,"Sutherlandia frutescens is a shrub native to South Africa and the coast of West Africa. This plant and its related species have been used in traditional medicine to treat diabetes, chicken pox, external wounds, and cancer. Although Sutherlandia is not generally consumed as a dietary supplement in the West, some use the raw herb as an adaptogen. Constituents in Sutherlandia have antiviral, antibacterial, antifungal and anticancer properties . A few case reports suggest it may help decrease fatigue in cancer patients , but whether it could be used as a treatment for cancer has not been studied in humans. Due to limited access to pharmaceuticals, an effort in Africa to promote local herbs to treat AIDS has included Sutherlandia . However in a double-blind safety trial in adults with HIV, patients randomized to S. frutescens did not have changes in viral load or CD4 T-lymphocyte count, but did have longer duration of secondary infection . Adverse effects are rare but Sutherlandia may interact with CYP3A4 and P-glycoprotein substrate drugs, and particularly drugs used to treat AIDS or prevent tuberculosis .",,"In vitro studies suggest Sutherlandia has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects (9). The constituent pinitol demonstrated antidiabetic effects by increasing availability of glucose for cell metabolism (2). Sutherlandia upregulated VAMP3, a gene which plays a role in vesicle transport, and also regulated 26 other genes that code for vesicle transporters, receptors, signalling molecules, transcription factors, and metabolic enzymes (14). GABA found in the dry leaves of this herb can slow down nerve cell activity (2).
An ethanolic extract of Sutherlandia inhibited growth of MCF-7 breast adenocarcinoma cells by inducing apoptosis (10) (11). Sutherlandia also downregulated metalloproteinases that control cell migration, proliferation, and apoptosis, and regulate tumor expansion, angiogenesis, and dissemination (10).","Leaf |

The root extracts are used in Germany for treating respiratory infections . Patients take supplemental forms to treat common cold and acute bronchitis. In vitro studies indicate that P. sidoides has antibacterial , antiviral , immunomodulatory , and anti-adhesive properties. Data from clinical trials suggest effectiveness against acute bronchitis and against rhinosinusitis . Meta-analyses suggest a significant decrease in bronchitis symptoms with P. sidoides use and benefit in pediatric respiratory tract infections . An herbal preparation from P. sidoides root was found effective for moderate to severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) .",,"Polyphenols (eg, catechin) and 7-hydroxy-coumarins (eg, umckalin), the main constituents, have antimicrobial and immunomodulatory effects (1). Other constituents include polymeric proanthocyanidins, monomeric flavan-3-ols, phenolic acids, and gallic acid as well as small amounts of quercetin and sitosterol-glucoside (5).
P. sidoides extract increased natural killer cell formation, tumor necrosis factor alpha, iNO, and interferon-beta release, and also demonstrated anti-adhesive effects (5). In addition, the extract improved peripheral blood phagocytes by enhancing oxidative burst and intracellular killing in vitro (11). Anti-HIV effects may occur through inhibiting the attachment of viral particles to target cells (17).",Root extract,EPs 7630,Pelargonium sidoides,,Pelargonium sidoides,

DSI002212,Fucoidan,,"Fucoidan is a sulfated polysaccharide found in the cell walls of many species of brown seaweed. In vitro studies show that it has antitumor, antiangiogenic , antiviral , antiarthritic , and immunomodulatory effects. Fucoidan also exhibited neuroprotective , radioprotective , and antiulcer properties. In animal models, fucoidan exerts anti-inflammatory effects to protect against various organ injuries and improved inflammatory pathology of acute colitis . Although a high molecular weight fucoidan did not improve outcomes in mice following intracerebral hemorrhage, it is suggested that low-molecular-weight fucoidans have increased therapeutic potential and should be evaluated for this purpose . In humans, dietary fucoidan modulates platelet aggregation via anti-thrombotic effects . In overweight or obese adults, fucoidan over 3 months decreased diastolic blood pressure and LDL cholesterol, and increased insulin secretion . Fucoidan also decreased pro-viral load in a small group of patients with human T-lymphotropic virus type-1-associated neurological disease . Fucoisan consumption for one month prior to influenza vaccination may boost post-vaccination antibody production in immune-compromised elderly . Preclinical data suggest that fucoidan can help relieve cyclophosphamide-induced intestinal mucosal injury by altering gut flora, resulting in reduced inflammation . Oral fucoidan in a small group of volunteers improved mobilization of hematopoietic progenitor stem cells with high levels of CXCR4 expression . In advanced cancer patients, fucoidan coadministration enabled patients to continue chemotherapy, regulated fatigue , and reduced levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines . Because fucoidan demonstrates anticoagulant and antithrombotic activities, it may have additive effects when taken with anticoagulants. In a small study of breast cancer patients, co-administration of fucoidan with either of two hormonal therapies, letrozole or tamoxifen, was well tolerated and did not result in any clinically significant interactions .",,"In vitro, a low-molecular-weight fucoidan inhibited human rheumatoid arthritis fibroblast synoviocytes and triggered apoptosis via decreased expression and secretion of MMP-1, -3, and -9, and suppression of NF-kB binding activity, p65 nuclear translocation, and IkappaB-alpha degradation (18). In animal models, fucoidan protected against liver injury via suppression of the inflammatory signaling pathway, inflammatory mediators, and inflammatory cell infiltration (20). It also reduced production of cyclooygenase-2 and NO, while increasing expression of the hepatoprotective enzyme hemeoxygenase-1 on murine liver and HepG2 cells (21). Fucoidan suppressed inflammation in an ultraviolet B-irradiated mouse model, decreasing thickness of the prickle cell layer and MMP-1 (19).
In humans, dietary fucoidan shortens lysis time of the thrombus by elevating prostacyclin secretion caused by increased H2O2 production in the blood (24). Various antitumor, antiviral and immune-modulating effects are attributed to NK cell stimulation, and downregulation of transcription factor AP-I and IGF-IR signaling (2) (3) (32). In melanoma cells, it increased lapatinib effects via ERBB3 inhibition (33). In human colorectal cells, it reduced tumor-promoting M2 macrophages and in combination with etoposide, prevented HCT116 tumorigenicity (34). Neuroprotective effects are attributed to suppression of TNF-alpha- and IFNγ-induced NO production in C6 glioma cells (11) and to antioxidative effects (12). Fucoidan inhibits metastasis by preventing adhesion of tumor cells to the extracellular matrix (4). It induced apoptosis of human T-cell leukemia virus type I that causes adult T-cell leukemia by inactivating NF-kB, which regulates antiapoptotic proteins (3). In a murine model, fucoidan suppressed angiogenesis induced by sarcoma 180 cells (5).",Undaria pinnatifida -  whole plant | Several species of brown seaweed,Sulfated alpha-L-fucan | Fucoidin | Fucan | Mekabu fucoidan,Fucoidan,Fucoidan,Fucoidan,

DSI002299,Arnica,C0052387,"Arnica is a perennial herb found in East Asia, Europe, the northern United States, and Canada. Its medicinal history dates back several centuries and arnica continues to be popular today. Its flowers and roots have been used to treat bruises, sprains, arthritic pain, and muscle aches. A highly diluted form of arnica is also used in homeopathic remedies. In vitro studies show that arnica has antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties. A few clinical trials suggest that topical arnica is helpful for osteoarthritis , and significantly reduces bruising compared with placebo or low-concentration vitamin K ointments . However, a small study reported that topical arnica actually increased pain 24 hours after calf exercises . Studies on postoperative benefits from use of arnica are mixed. It reduced swelling in patients following knee surgery , reduced pain following tonsillectomy , and may reduce bruising from rhinoplasty , but was not helpful after blepharoplasty . A recent meta-analysis of homeopathic arnica for postoperative recovery suggests a small effect size for preventing excess bruising and related sequelae . Rigorous research is needed to determine the clinical benefits of homeopathic arnica.",,"Sesquiterpene lactones, the active constituents in arnica, have anti-inflammatory properties and inhibit binding of transcription factors AP-1 and NF-κB to DNA (14). A tincture prepared from arnica flowers suppressed collagenase-1 (MMP1) and interstitial collagenase-13 (MMP13) mRNA levels in human articular chondrocytes in vitro (14). MMP13 and MMP1 enzymes are thought to play a significant role in cartilage and joint destruction and inflammation seen in osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. Both arnica tinctures and sesquiterpene lactones were found to suppress NF-κB activation and IL-12 production in dendritic cells at high concentrations, but can also have immunostimulatory effects when diluted (2). Another study found that sesquiterpene lactones inhibit platelet function by interacting with platelet sulfhydryl groups, probably associated with reduced phospholipase A2 activity (12). In addition to sesquiterpene lactones, the allergenic potential of arnica may be partly due to other allergens such as polyacetylenes (15).",Dried underground parts,Mountain tobacco | Leopard's bane | Wolf's bane | Mountain arnica,Arnica,Arnica | Arnica (unspecified) | Hairy Arnica,Arnica,

Preclinical studies suggest that oral comfrey has antiproliferative effects , and a topical formulation showed wound healing properties . Studies in humans are very limited. Although preliminary data on topical formulations suggest it may relieve pain , a Cochrane Review of herbal medicine for low back pain did not find sufficient evidence for its use . Comfrey contains pyrrolizidine alkaloids that are hepatotoxic, mutagenic, and carcinogenic , and hepatotoxicity with oral use of comfrey has been cited in the medical literature . In addition, misidentification with foxglove has led to several cases of accidental ingestion of what was thought to be comfrey herbal tea, resulting in cardiac glycoside poisonings . Comfrey was used since the 1930s for animal feed, but has been prohibited in Australia and New Zealand. In June 2001, the FDA asked all manufacturers to remove products containing comfrey from the market .",,"Preclinical studies suggest allantoin and rosmarinic acid compounds in comfrey may be responsible for cell proliferation and anti-inflammatory effects (20). Comfrey was also shown to stimulate granulation and tissue regeneration, and support callus formation (19).
Although systemic absorption following use of topical comfrey preparations is not known, an evaluation in human skin samples suggests there may be an overestimation of risk for pyrrolizidine alkaloid absorption (25).",Fresh underground parts,Slippery root | Knitbone | Blackwort | Bruisewort,Symphytum,Comfrey,Comfrey,

DSI002365,Boswellia,C2608032,"Boswellia serrata is a tree prevalent in India, the Middle East and North Africa. The gummy exudate or resin obtained by peeling away the bark is commonly known as frankincense or olibanum. Boswellia is used widely in Ayurveda for treating arthritis, ulcerative colitis, coughs, sores, wound healing, and asthma. It is also available in supplemental forms to support joint health. The bioactive compound in boswellia is boswellic acid , a 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor. It showed anti-inflammatory, anti-arthritic , cytotoxic and radio-enhancing effects , and prevented intestinal tumorigenesis in a murine model . Other animal studies suggest boswellia may improve cognitive impairment and insulin resistance ; and essential oil of boswellia demonstrated antimicrobial property . In clinical studies, boswellia extracts ; a formulation containing boswellia, Terminalia chebula and turmeric ; as well as boswellic acid combined with curcumin were all reported useful in patients with osteoarthritis although data are conflicting . Supplements containing boswellia were also reported useful for alleviating symptoms of tendinopathy , were comparable to acetaminophen in reducing musculoskeletal pain , and reduced aromatase inhibitor-induced joint pain . Additional studies suggest benefits in patients with oral aphthous lesions , bronchial asthma , ulcerative colitis , mild irritable bowel syndrome , and osteo-muscular pain . Larger trials are needed to confirm these effects. As well, evidence is unclear or negative surrounding boswellia’s effectiveness against collagenous colitis , with no significant benefit in maintaining remission in patients with Crohn’s disease . Preliminary findings suggest that boswellia may be effective in reducing cerebral edema in patients with brain tumors following radio- and radiochemotherapy , and topical use prevented radiation-induced skin damage in breast cancer patients . Also, boswellia formulations helped reduce mammary density, a risk factor for breast cancer ; and decreased genitourinary pain in men with prostatitis-like symptoms . Although similar in many functions, boswellia should not be confused with guggul or myrrh.",,"Boswellic acid, the major constituent of boswellia, is thought to contribute to many of the herb’s pharmacological activities. Preclinical studies show that anti-inflammatory activity occurs via inhibition of 5-lipoxygenase (2) (3) and cyclooxygenase-1 (35). Boswellic acid also inhibits nuclear transcription factor KappaB (NF-KappaB) signaling, markedly decreasing production of the key proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor (TNF-alpha) (17). Unlike other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, however, it failed to show analgesic or antipyretic effects (16).
Research on cytotoxic effects of boswellic acid indicates that it induces p21 expression through a p53-independent pathway and causes apoptosis in glioma (4) (6) and leukemia (5) cell lines. A boswellia extract induced apoptosis in a cervical cancer cells by inducing endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress (18). Other apoptotic mechanisms include early generation of nitric oxide and reactive oxygen species that upregulated time-dependent expression of p53/p21/PUMA (19), inhibition of microsomal prostaglandin E synthase-1 (mPGES-1), and decreased prostaglandin (PGE2) levels and its downstream targets (37).
A semisynthetic analog of boswellic acid, 3-alpha-Butyryloxy-beta-boswellic acid, demonstrated significant growth inhibition in Ehrlich Ascitic Tumour (EAT), Ehrlich Ascitic Carcinoma (EAC) and Sarcoma-180 tumor models, via NF-KappaB downregulation and induction of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage (27). Acetyl-boswellic acids inhibited topoisomerases by competing with DNA for binding sites (20). Acetyl-11-keto-beta-boswellic acid (AKBA) inhibited human prostate tumor growth via inhibition of VEGFR2-induced angiogenesis (22). The antiplatelet effects of boswellia gum resin extracts are attributed to inhibition of clotting factors Xa and XIa. (34).",Resin | Stem bark oleogum resin,Indian frankincense,Boswellia Carterii | Boswellia,Boswellia | Frankincense,Boswellia,

DSI002367,Vinpocetine,C0059752,"Vinpocetine is derived from vincamine, an alkaloid found in the common periwinkle plant. Originally developed in Europe where it is marketed as a drug called Cavinton, vinpocetine is sold in the United States as a dietary supplement to improve brain function. Animal models suggest that vinpocetine has anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antimitotic, antiatherogenic, antithrombotic, and antiepileptic effects . Human studies suggest vinpocetine enhances short-term memory , cognitive performance , and improves chronic cerebral dysfunction in elderly patients . It has also been studied as a potential treatment for Alzheimer’s disease , but a systematic review did not find benefit . In both healthy adult volunteers and patients with focal epilepsy, no significant cognitive benefits were seen with the vinpocetine dosages tested . Other small studies suggest vinpocetine may help maintain or improve hemorheologic parameters in patients with cerebrovascular disorders , but a systematic review did not find enough evidence for benefit in patients with acute ischemic stroke . In a randomized open-label study, intravenous vinpocetine adjunctive to treatment for acute cerebral infarction improved cerebral blood flow, neurological functioning, and cognition . Vinpocetine inhibits the growth of breast cancer cells in vitro and in vivo . In animal studies, it potentiates the effects of radiation therapy in tumor cells . In nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients following radiation injury, preliminary data suggest potential with a combination of vinpocetine and dexamethasone for cognitive impairment compared with dexamethasone alone . However, studies in cancer patients in general are lacking. Vinpocetine should not be confused with chemotherapy drugs such as vincristine or vinblastine, which are also alkaloids derived from the periwinkle plant.",,"Vinpocetine is a synthetic ethyl ester of apovincamine derived from an alkaloid in the common periwinkle plant (17). In vitro, antioxidant and hydroxyl radical scavenging properties have been observed (18) (13). Vinpocetine inhibits PDE1 activity and improves cerebral blood flow by elevating cGMP and cAMP, increasing mitochondrial function, and improving glucose and oxygen utilization by the brain. Vinpocetine helps improve spatial memory in rats by preventing neuronal damage and favorably modulating cholinergic function (18). Antiepileptic effects were attributed to suppression of abnormal neuronal excitability via sodium channel regulation and dopamine release in striatal nerve endings (5) (6) (7). Vinpocetine antagonizes platelet-derived growth factor-induced extracellular matrix synthesis, suppresses intracellular ROS production, and inhibits extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 activation and vascular smooth muscle cell growth (4). Antiatherogenic effects occur through inhibition of monocyte adhesion, oxidative stress, and inflammatory responses mediated by protein kinase B/nuclear factor kappa B-dependent pathways (3). Vinpocetine also demonstrates anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting TNF-α-induced NF-κB activities (19) as well as Akt and STAT3 activation (15). In a murine model of otitis media, vinpocetine suppressed S. pneumoniae-induced mucus production through mucin MUC5AC inhibition (27).
In vitro and in vivo studies indicate vinpocetine antitumor activity against human breast cancer cells occurs through G0/G1-phase cell cycle arrest and mitochondrial pathways of apoptosis (15). Vinpocetine may also increase the effects of radiation by increasing tumor oxygenation (16).
In humans, administration of vinpocetine to chronic stroke patients increased glucose uptake and release in unaffected areas of the brain (12). In a study of adjuvant vinpocetine, nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients had lower levels of serum inflammatory cytokines compared to those who received dexamethasone monotherapy (34).",Synthetic,Vinpocetine | Periwinkle | Vinca minor | Kavinton; Cavinton | Rgh-4405 | Tcv-3B | Apovincaminic acid,Vinpocetine,Vinpocetine,Vinpocetine,

DSI002390,Evening primrose oil,C0700602,"Derived from the plant Oenothera biennis, evening primrose oil is used for rheumatoid arthritis, premenstrual syndrome, eczema, fatigue, diabetic neuropathy, and mastalgia. The mucilaginous stem and leaf juices have been used as a poultice to treat minor bruises and wounds, and soothe skin inflammation . Evening primrose oil is thought to improve skin moisture and reduce transepidermal water loss . It is also among the popular natural products used to relieve menopausal symptoms . In vitro, evening primrose oil demonstrates anti-inflammatory activity and inhibits platelet aggregation . In animal models, it exerts anti-angiogenic, anti-inflammatory, and anti-arthritic effects , and improved cardiac recovery after myocardial infarction . Human studies on whether evening primrose oil is helpful for skin conditions are limited and mixed. Small trials suggest benefit in atopic dermatitis , but other analyses did not find evening primrose oil or borage oil effective for eczema . In acne patients treated with oral isotretinoin, evening primrose oil may improve xerotic cheilitis . It may also reduce 5-azacitidine-induced skin reactions in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome . Other preliminary data suggest benefit in some lipid profiles , rheumatoid arthritis symptoms , ulcerative colitis , or for ocular surface diseases such as dry eye , but early studies in diabetic neuropathy were equivocal . More recently, gamma-linolenic acid (GLA) derived from evening primrose oil was found noninferior to alpha-lipoic acid for reducing pain in patients with diabetic neuropathy . In multiple sclerosis patients, evening primrose oil may improve fatigue and quality of life , and along with hemp seed and a diet high in antioxidants, it may improve clinical and immunological parameters . Additional data indicate that supplementation with vitamin E and evening primrose oil reduced cyclical mastalgia , but other analyses did not find improvements in breast pain or premenstrual syndrome . Evening primrose oil may improve quality of life and decrease hot flash intensity in menopausal women , although other data suggest that behavioral/lifestyle approaches such as exercise provide better relief . In postmenopausal women, it improved related psychological symptoms , but more study is needed to confirm these effects. Studies in cancer patients are quite limited, with one trial involving liver cancer patients that showed no effect on tumor size or survival , and another that suggested GLA may be an effective adjunctive therapy for breast cancer . Although evening primrose oil does not have intrinsic estrogenic properties, some commercial products combine evening primrose oil with phytoestrogens. Therefore, patients with hormone-sensitive cancers should use evening primrose oil products with caution.",,"Evening primrose oil is rich in the omega-6 fatty acid GLA, which can be converted directly to the prostaglandin precursor dihomo-GLA (DGLA) (2) (3). Administration of the oil may benefit individuals unable to metabolize cis-linolenic acid to GLA, producing subsequent intermediates of metabolic significance including prostaglandins (2) (3).
In vitro, long-chain fatty alcohols such as hexacosanol, tetracosanol, docosanol, and octocosanol demontrated anti-inflammatory activity (29). In animal models, benefits on cardiac recovery after myocardial infarction were attributed to its hypocholesterolemic effect and indirect influence on prostaglandins and cytokine synthesis (31). In arthiritis models, evening primrose oil normalized body weight, angiopoietin-1, and TNF-alpha levels, and reduced malondialdehyde levels, synovial hyperplasia, and inflammatory cell invasion in joint tissues (30).
In patients with multiple sclerosis, evening primrose oil accelerates anti-inflammatory responses and prevents pro-inflammatory cytokine production while helping to maintain fatty acid membranes and optimizing balance between saturated and unsaturated fatty acids (40). Increases in plasma GLA and its metabolite DGLA seen with evening primrose oil supplementation has correlated with clinical improvements in atopic dermatitis (32) and produced dose-dependent effects on serum fatty acid levels and eczema severity scores (25). Inhibition of cheilitis is attributed to GLA’s effects on stratum corneum maturation, differentiation, and preservation of its permeability barrier (34). Antiplatelet and anticoagulant effects are likely related to decreased thromboxane B2 synthesis induced by evening primrose oil (46) (47).",Oenothera biennis - Seed,Evening primrose oil | Night willow herb | Fever plant | King's cure-all,Evening primrose oil | Evening Primrose Oil,evening primrose oil,Evening Primrose Oil,

DSI002469,Arctium,C1096751,"Burdock, a perennial plant native to Europe and Northern Asia, is now found worldwide. The root has been consumed as food in Asia for many centuries. Burdock fruit is valued in traditional Chinese medicine as a blood purifier, a cure for sore throat and colds, and as a topical remedy for skin disorders including acne, eczema and psoriasis. It is also used to treat anorexia, gout, cancer and AIDS. Burdock showed anti-inflammatory , antibacterial , antiulcerogenic , hepatoprotective , antidiabetic and anticancer effects in preclinical studies. In small studies, topical use of a formula containing burdock improved dermal extracellular matrix metabolism and visibly reduced wrinkles . Oral intake of burdock tea improved inflammatory markers in patients with knee osteoarthritis and formulations containing burdock improved lipid metabolism and postprandial blood glucose in patients with diabetic nephropathy , may be useful against Helicobacter pylori infection and reduce the frequency and intensity of night sweats in postmenopausal women . Confirmatory studies are needed. A burdock tea was found contaminated with atropine, an alkaloid . Patients should be aware that poor quality control is a major concern with commercial herbal products. Burdock is also one of the ingredients in the herbal tea Essiac , which is promoted as an alternative cancer treatment.",,"Arctiin and arctigenin, the lignans present in burdock, exert anti-inflammatory effects by inhibit the pro-inflammatory factors, nitric oxide (NO), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-a), and interleukin-6 (IL-6) (3) (4). The polyacetylenes and chlorogenic acid have antibacterial properties and are thought responsible for burdock’s beneficial effects against infections and skin disorders (11).
Arctigenin and arctiin, along with lignans matairesinol, (iso)lappaol A, lappaol C, and lappaol F were shown to up-regulate the expression of Jun-N-terminal kinase-1 (jnk-1), and promote longetivty and stress resistance in the round worm Caenorhabditis elegans via the JNK-1-DAF-16 cascade (15).
Animal studies indicate that burdock extract induces hypoglycemia and increases carbohydrate tolerance, stimulates uterine smooth muscle, and has antimutagenic activity. The tannin extract induces macrophage response (8). Burdock also exhibits hepatoprotective effects in rats due to its antioxidative activity (6).
Further, Lappaol F was shown to induce G(1) and G(2) cell-cycle arrest, induce cell death in several cancer cell lines, and to activate caspases (16). In other studies, arctigenin inhibited the proliferation, and induced caspase-3-dependent apoptosis of ovarian cancer cells via suppression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS)/nitric oxide (NO)/signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 (STAT3)/survivin signalling pathway (17).",Root | Root,Lappa | Wild gobo | Happy major | Niubang,Arctium Lappa | Arctium pubens,Burdock,Burdock,

DSI002496,Emblica officinalis,C3473318,"Emblica officinalis is a deciduous tree prevalent in parts of Asia. All parts of the tree, especially the fruit, are commonly used in traditional medicine for various ailments including diarrhea, jaundice, headaches, inflammation, and as a tonic . It is also a constituent of the popular Ayurvedic formulation, Triphala. The activity of E. officinalis is often attributed to its antioxidant constituents, such as ascorbic acid, polyphenols, flavonoids, and tannins . Preclinical studies indicate antioxidant , antibacterial , hepatoprotective , cardioprotective radioprotective , antiulcerogenic , antitumor , analgesic , antidiabetic and antihyperlipidemic properties. Limited clinical data suggest benefits in patients with uremia by reducing oxidative stress , for improving HDL and lowering LDL-cholesterol levels in diabetic patients , and for lowering lipid levels and blood pressure in patients with hyperlipidemia , but ineffective in reducing hypertension . Supplementation with an E. officinalis extract was shown to lower multiple risk factors associated with cardiovascular disease in overweight adults , and as an adjunct, useful in the management of metabolic syndrome . It was also found to benefit those with non-erosive reflux disease , and helped reduce inflammation and periodontal destruction in patients with chronic periodontitis . Because E. officinalis exhibits strong antioxidant effects, it may interfere with chemotherapy and radiation therapy.",,"The antioxidant activity of E. officinalis is attributed to the high content of ascorbic acid (4), but it was reported that such effects may be due to the tannins, Emblicanin A and Emblicanin B (1). The antidiabetic property is thought to be due to the herb’s ability to reduce release of inflammatory cytokines that cause insulin resistance (12). E. officinalis may also play a role in preventing age-related hyperlipidemia by reducing nitric oxide synthase and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) protein levels via inhibiting NF-kappa B activation (13). In another study, the herb extracts were shown to induce apoptosis in mature osteoclasts, an effect that may limit bone resorption in pathologies associated with bone loss (15). And a hydroalcoholic extract of E. officinalis demonstrated anti-inflammatory effects by increasing glutathione, superoxide dismutase, and catalase activities, and subsequently decreasing lipid peroxidation (19).
Several studies have also investigated the antitumor properties of E. officinalis. Pyrogallol, a component of E. officinalis extract, was found to cause cell cycle arrest in the G2/M phase, inhibit proliferation, and induce apoptosis in human lung adenocarcinoma (H441) and squamous cell cancer (H520) cell lines (2). Intraperitoneal pyrogallol injections also suppressed subcutaneous tumor growth in mice (2). An aqueous extract decreased tumor volume through inhibiting the cell cycle regulating enzyme CDC25 (10). Progallin, extracted from E. officinalis leaves, also caused cell cycle arrest in the G1/M and G2/M phase, inhibited proliferation, and induce apoptosis in human hepatocellular carcinoma cells (BEL-7404) (14). In other studies, E. officinalis extracts were shown to inhibit cell growth both in vitro and in vivo possibly via inhibition of angiogenesis and activation of autophagy in ovarian cancer cells (20); and demonstrated cardioprotective effects against doxorubicin toxicity in vitro (3), which was attributed to antioxidants.",Fruit,Gooseberry | amla | amalaka | amalaki,Emblica officinalis,,Emblica officinalis,

DSI002549,Rhamnus purshiana,C3486388,"Cascara sagrada is a species of buckthorn plant native to North America. The bark of the plant has been used to relieve constipation and is marketed as a dietary supplement. It is also used as an ingredient in the Hoxsey herbal formula, an ineffective alternative cancer treatment. The major constituents are cascarosides that stimulate the large intestine and produce a laxative effect. In vitro studies suggest that emodin, one of the constituents, has hepatoprotective , neuroprotective , anti-osteoporotic , and chemopreventive effects . Emodin also enhances the cytotoxic effects of some chemotherapeutic agents . However, human studies have not been conducted to confirm these effects. Prolonged use or overdose of cascara can cause diarrhea, electrolyte imbalance, and hepatitis .",,"Cascarosides stimulate the large intestine, increasing intestinal motility and contractions to produce a well-documented laxative effect. Increased water and electrolyte content in the lumen also results, which further facilitates bowel passage. The constituent emodin has direct excitatory effect on circular smooth muscle cells in the large intestine (9).
Emodin may play a protective role against osteoporosis. It was shown to suppress the receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) ligand (RANKL)-induced osteoclast differentiation of bone marrow macrophages (BMMs), and the bone resorption of mature osteoclasts via inhibiting expression of RANKL-induced NF-κB, c-Fos, and NFATc1 (21).
In vitro studies suggest anticancer properties, as aloe-emodin induces p53 and p21 expression that results in G1-phase cell cycle arrest (8). However, more studies are needed to confirm such effects. Studies on the carcinogenic effects of cascara have produced conflicting results (4) (5) (6) (10).",Aged root | Food flavoring agent,Cascara sagrada | Sacred bark,Rhamnus purshiana,Cascara,Cascara,

DSI002555,Borago,C0522464,"Borage oil, derived from the seeds of the plant, is a rich source of gamma-linolenic acid (GLA) and linoleic acid (LA). In herbal and traditional medicine, borage oil has been used to induce sweating, as an expectorant and anti-inflammatory, to promote lactation, to stimulate adrenal function, and as an alternative source to evening primrose oil for obtaining GLA . It has also been promoted to treat rheumatoid arthritis, atopic dermatitis, diabetic neuropathy, menopause-related symptoms, and gastrointestinal disease . Preclinical studies suggest antimutagenic, cytotoxic, and chemopreventive effects . In an animal model of senile osteoporosis, a diet rich in borage or fish oils reduced inflammation and improved bone parameters . Borage extract consumption improved markers of disease-induced cognitive dysfunction in Alzheimer’s models . In humans, studies suggest that GLA from borage seed oil has some benefits in treating rheumatoid arthritis (RA) . A long-term study of fish and borage seed oils either alone or in combination suggest these may be useful to correct dyslipidemia in RA patients at increased risk for cardiovascular disease . Other analyses suggest moderate evidence of GLA-containing oils for relief of RA pain and disability without increased adverse events, but dose and treatment duration are unknown and there was not enough evidence to support their current use in RA management . In a preliminary double-blind trial, a borage extract improved clinical findings of moderate asthma, but not related inflammation . In patients with mild asthma, a combination of seed oils from borage and echium, a plant rich in LA, produced anti-inflammatory effects . In patients with early type 2 diabetes or metabolic syndrome, this combination also lowered total and LDL cholesterol levels . In a study of postmenopausal hypertensive women, short-term borage oil supplementation significantly reduced blood pressure and waist-to-hip ratio . Studies are mixed on whether borage oil can help skin conditions such as atopic eczema and several analyses indicate that neither evening primrose nor borage oil are effective for this purpose, with improvements being similar to respective placebos . Borage oil contains pyrrolizidine alkaloids that are hepatotoxic . Risk of hepatic damage increases with length of exposure and cumulative dose consumed. Patients should use borage oil certified free of unsaturated pyrrolizidine alkaloids. Borage should not be used during pregnancy or when breastfeeding .",,"Anti-inflammatory properties of borage oil have been attributed to its high GLA content (16). It also contains other fatty acids including linoleic, oleic, palmitic, stearic, eicosenoic, and erucic acids (28). GLA can be converted to the prostaglandin precursor dihomo-gama-linolenic acid. DGLA can block transformation of arachidonic acid to leukotrienes and other prostaglandins (10). GLA can increase cAMP levels which suppress synthesis of TNF-alpha, an inflammatory mediator linked to rheumatoid arthritis (9). The mucilage constituent has an expectorant-like action and malic acid has a mild diuretic effect. The tannin constituent may have mild astringent and constipating actions (3).
In vitro, a borage oil formulation demonstrated inhibitory effects on alpha-amylase, an enzyme that hydrolyzes 1,4-alpha-glucoside bonds in oligo- and polysaccharides, the first step in digesting dietary starch and glycogen (29). In animal models, borage oil improved amyloid-beta-induced long-term potentiation disruption in the hippocampal dentate gyrus, providing a neuroprotective effect attributed to the scavenging of free radicals (18). Borage-enriched sunflower oil counteracted pro-inflammatory mechanisms and prevented senile osteoporosis by inhibiting osteoblast-induced osteoclast formation (17).
In human studies, dietary supplementation with borage and echium seed oils produced anti-inflammatory effects in mild asthmatics by altering polyunsaturated fatty acid levels and attenuating leukotriene production (24). Individual genetic variation in fatty acid desaturase as a gene–diet interaction has been proposed to explain heterogeneity of anti-inflammatory effects in clinical trials. One study demonstrated that borage oil elevated serum GLA and DGLA in an rs174537 genotype-dependent manner, and further suggests that “one size fits all” supplementation may not be appropriate (40).
Although aerial parts of borage demonstrate affinity for the serotonin transporter, toxicity profiles preclude its further development as an herbal drug (30). Borage contains several minor constituents known as pyrrolizidine alkaloids which are hepatotoxic, including amabiline, supinine, lycopsamine, intermedine, acetyllycopsamine and acetylintermedine (26) (31). Borage oil also has teratogenic effects, and its prostaglandin E agonist action may cause premature labor (9).",Seed(s),Bee plant | Bee bread | Borage seed oil | Ox's tongue | Starflower oil,Borago Officinalis Seed Oil,Borage,Borage,

DSI002589,Cranberry,C2740793,"Cranberry is an evergreen shrub that is grown in North America and Europe. The processed fruit and juice, both rich in vitamin C, are widely consumed as food. The juice extract is marketed as a dietary supplement for urinary tract health and to prevent urinary tract infections (UTIs). It has also been used for oral and gastrointestinal infections, cardiovascular diseases, and to protect against cancer. In preclinical studies, cranberry juice extracts and constituents exhibited antibacterial , antimicrobial , antifungal , anti-inflammatory , antioxidant , and antiadherence properties. Studies on whether cranberry products can prevent UTIs have been conducted in various populations, but results are mixed. Cranberry extracts can help prevent UTIs in adults , children , prostate cancer patients undergoing radiation therapy , and patients following urostomy . In women undergoing pelvic floor surgery, cranberry prophylaxis had no beneficial effects against UTIs, although UTI prevalence overall was lower than expected . A large double-blind study of older adults with high-baseline UTI risk showed benefit , but another similar study reported negative findings . A subsequent analysis revealed increased costs with no meaningful reduction in UTI rates in a geriatric nursing home environment . Studies of cranberry juice for recurrent UTIs have also been mixed, with one study finding no benefit among college-aged women , and another observing significant reductions in UTI relapse in women over age 50 . Cranberry was not as effective or cost-effective as trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole in preventing UTIs in premenopausal women, but patients were less likely to develop antibiotic-resistant bacteria . In volunteers from different regions, anti-adhesion activity with cranberry powder was found to be dose-dependent . Overall, a systematic review determined that cranberry juice was more effective than capsules or tablets , but despite some support for recurrent UTI prophylaxis , there is not enough evidence to recommend cranberry juice for UTI prevention . In other studies, cranberry juice inhibited adhesion of H. pylori to human gastric mucosa , and regular consumption may suppress H. pylori infection , a major factor in peptic ulcer disease and gastric cancer. When used with standard treatment, cranberry juice helped eradicate H. pylori . It potential to prevent plaque formation and gum disease as well may be due to its anticolonizing and antiadhesion properties . Preclinical studies suggest antiproliferative effects against prostate , liver , lung , neuroblastoma , breast , ovarian , gastric , colon , esophageal , and oral cancer cells with cranberry extracts and proanthocyanidins. In humans however, cranberry juice did not lower oxidative status, suggesting a lack of protective effect against cancer or heart disease . Cranberry juice has high concentrations of oxalates, and should be avoided in patients at risk for kidney stones . Other data suggest it may be helpful in uncommon forms including struvite stones, which are associated with bladder infections .",,"The A-type linkages in cranberry proanthocyanidins (C-PACs) may enhance urinary bacterial antiadhesion activities to prevent UTIs (25) (26) (27) (28) (64). Similarly, bioactivity against C. albicans biofilm formation is due to anti-adherence properties and/or iron chelation (46). In susceptible populations, improved preventive effects with cranberry juice over capsules or tablets may be related to better hydration with liquid, and/or additive effects with additional compounds in juice not contained in supplements (56). Anti-adhesion properties were also demonstrated in other microenvironments. Cranberry prevented H. pylori-induced stomach ulcers by inhibiting bacterial adhesions in the stomach lining (18) (29), decreased adherence of oral streptococci strains to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite (23) and glucan-coated hydroxyapatite, and impaired biofilm formation (22) (30) indicating it may slow dental plaque development and protect against plaque-related diseases. Cranberry also regulated aggressive human periodontitis fibroblast inflammatory responses via nuclear factor-kappaB and matrix metalloproteinase-3 (MMP3) inhibition (47).
Additional studies have shown that C-PACs may play a role in enhancing host innate immunity. In a worm model, a standardized cranberry extract mediated host immune response via p38 MAPK signaling, insulin/insulin-like growth factor 1 signaling, and heat shock factor 1 (45). Antiatherogenic effects of cranberry juice occur via reductions in serum glucose and apoB, and increases in serum and apoA-1 and paraoxonase, associated with stabilizing HDL (61).
Mechanisms underlying the anticancer effects of cranberry extracts and C-PACs have also been investigated. A cranberry extract inhibited prostate cancer cell growth by decreasing cyclins, cyclin-dependant kinase expression (10) , and MMP activity (31). Dose-response inhibition of gastric cancer cells to cranberry is in part due to decreased proliferating cell nuclear antigen expression and apoptotic induction (59). A proanthocyanidin isolate arrested ovarian cancer cell growth by inhibiting VEGF and generating ROS (15). C-PACs induced cell death in esophageal adenocarcinoma via microRNA modifications within cancer cells (60), and in human lung cancer cells, they altered gene expression, induced apoptosis, and modulated cell-cycle processes (57). In high-risk neuroblastoma cells, a purified C-PAC induced apoptosis and ROS generation, and encouraged cyclophosphamide retention with synergistic cytotoxic benefits (58).
Cranberry juice increases the risk of uric acid stone formation because of its acidifying effect and slowing of urate synthesis, thereby decreasing urinary pH (32) (33).","Vaccinium macrocarpon- Fruit | Cranberry can be consumed as juice, sauce, or dried fruit.",Mossberry | Sassamanash | Bounceberry,Cranberry,Cranberry Protein | Cranberry Fiber | Mountain Cranberry (unspecified) | Small Cranberry,Cranberry,

DSI002597,Cinnamon,C2740768,"Cinnamon refers to several plants that belong to the genus Cinnamomum, native to Southeast Asia. The bark, rich in essential oil, is used as a flavoring agent and as a spice. Medicinal uses include appetite stimulation, and treatment of arthritis, inflammation, and dyspepsia. In traditional Chinese medicine, cinnamon is used along with other herbs in decoctions to treat colds. In vitro studies suggest that cinnamon has antioxidant , anti-inflammatory , immunomodulatory , antimicrobial , antitumor , and antiestrogenic properties. Studies in humans have also been conducted. In clinical trials of cinnamon for type 2 diabetes, results are conflicting . Various meta-analyses and a review suggest some improvements in glycemic control with cinnamon and its extracts , but studies had high heterogeneity and larger well-designed trials are needed. Other meta-analyses suggest cinnamon supplementation may reduce blood triglycerides, total cholesterol concentrations , and C-reactive protein levels , but again well-designed studies are needed to confirm these effects. Other preliminary data suggest cinnamon extracts may decrease insulin resistance in women with polycystic ovary syndrome ; improve parameters of metabolic syndrome ; and reduce dental plaque and gingivitis . Studies involving topical use of a cinnamon ointment suggest it can relieve perineal pain and improve healing of episiotomy incisions in postpartum women . In a safety study of patients with prediabetes, a water-soluble cinnamon extract did not appear to affect electrocardiographic measures . However, certain cinnamon products are high in coumarin , which can cause hepatotoxicity and interact with other prescription drugs .",,"Hydroxycinnamaldehyde, a compound present in cinnamon, exerts anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting NO production via nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB (3). Cinnamon also inhibits hepatic HMG-CoA reductase activity (24) and reduces blood lipid levels in animals and humans (10). In another study, methylhydroxychalcone polymer isolated from cinnamon was shown to mimic insulin by activating the insulin receptors (23).
Cinnamon extract binds to estrogen-receptor beta and has a direct stimulatory effect on bone formation (25). The n-hexane extract of cinnamon has antiestrogenic activity (26). In other studies, increased proapoptotic activity with cinnamon extract was attributed to NF-kappaB and AP1 inhibition (7), while antiangiogenic effects occurred via VEGF inhibition (22).",Inner bark | Bark | Cinnamon bark,Cassia,Cinnamon | Cinnamon cassia,Cinnamon | Cinnamon (unspecified) | Cassia Cinnamon | Cinnamon Bark,Cinnamon,

It is also used in traditional medicine for treating inflammation, stomach problems, asthma, and other bronchial conditions. Preclinical studies suggest that myrrh has anti-inflammatory, cytotoxic , anti-trichomoniasis , and antipyretic effects . Other experiments suggest some constituents of myrrh may inhibit certain cancers , but human data are lacking. A small study suggests effectiveness of myrrh against trichomoniasis vaginalis in affected women . Other preliminary data on different herbal preparations containing myrrh suggest potential benefit as maintenance therapy in patients with ulcerative colitis and in women with type 2 diabetes , but additional studies are needed.",,"In animal studies, an aqueous suspension of C. molmol protected against gastric mucosal damage from NSAIDs and ethanol (7). C. molmol may have free radical-scavenging, thyroid-stimulating, and prostaglandin-inducing properties. These effects are caused by increased mucus production, and nucleic acid and non-protein sulfhydryl concentrations. Aqueous extracts of myrrh may induce hepatic microsomal enzymes, causing a more rapid metabolism of warfarin (10).
C. molmol inhibits the growth of Ehrlich carcinoma cells in mice (4). The cytotoxic activities appear to be as effective as cyclophosphamide in solid tumor-bearing mice. In one study, Na, K and Ca levels in cancer cells were reduced by treatment with C. molmol, leading to inhibition of cellular proliferation and tumor growth (3). Another in vitro study found that myrrh gum had tumoricidal effects against a malignant murine neuroblastoma cell line (5). The antiproliferative activity of sesquiterpenoids ST1 and ST2 from myrrh in human prostate cancer cells may occur through androgen receptor signaling inhibition (12).","Gum-resin from Commiphora molmol, Commiphora abyssinica, and other Commiphora species.",Mo Yao | Abyssinica | Heerabol,Myrrha | Myrrh,Myrrh,Myrrh,

DSI002820,SAMe,C0036002,"SAM-e is endogenously produced in the human body from adenosine triphosphate and methionine . It is involved in the formation of monoamine neurotransmitters such as serotonin and norepinephrine . Decreased SAM-e levels in cerebrospinal fluid are thought to contribute to the etiologies of depression and Alzheimer’s disease . SAM-e levels may also be decreased in chronic liver disease and AIDS-associated myelopathy . In the United States, SAM-e is marketed as a supplement to enhance mood, brain and neural function, joint mobility, and liver detoxification. It is also a prescription drug in other countries. Preclinical data suggest that SAM-e may have antidepressive , neuroprotective , anti-inflammatory , and chondroprotective effects. Other models suggest liver injury can be exacerbated by depleted SAM-e levels, and that supplementation may have hepatoprotective effects . In humans, data on whether SAM-e is an effective adjunct for major depressive disorder are mixed , and whether it is more effective than escitalopram or placebo is also unclear , although it may have greater therapeutic potential in men . Other double-blind studies have not found SAM-e, either as monotherapy or in a nutraceutical combination, helpful for major depressive disorder , and various analyses remain mixed on its potential benefit . Preliminary data suggest SAM-e may improve memory-related cognitive symptoms in depressed patients . However, studies that suggest cognitive benefits for patients with Alzheimer’s disease do not evaluate SAM-e in isolation . Although preliminary trials suggest some benefit in fibromyalgia patients , results are mixed on whether SAM-e is comparable with NSAIDs for osteoarthritis , and it did not significantly improve neurological measures in patients with AIDS-associated myelopathy . In addition, a steering committee examining whether dietary ingredients could help reduce pain determined there was insufficient evidence for SAM-e . For hot flashes, SAM-e was ineffective compared with historical placebo . Some trials suggest benefit in chronic liver disease . Addition of oral SAM-e to injected pegylated interferon alpha and oral ribavirin improved viral response in patients with chronic hepatitis C . Postoperative intravenous SAM-e therapy improved residual liver function in patients with cirrhosis . However, in patients with hepatitis C cirrhosis at elevated risk for hepatocellular carcinoma, oral SAM-e did not improve liver function or reduce injury or oxidative stress . Other preliminary data suggest it may be useful as adjunctive palliative therapy in advanced biliary tract carcinoma or protect against chemotherapy-induced liver toxicity . Additional confirmatory studies are needed to assess efficacy and safety. While generally well-tolerated, the therapeutic value of SAM-e in chronic liver disease is limited or yet to be determined. Because it is poorly absorbed, enteric-coated tablets are preferred. Outside the United States, parenteral formulations are used to treat fibromyalgia , osteoarthritis, and tendonitis as well as depression. However, patients with bipolar disorder or taking serotonergic medications including antidepressants should discuss any use of this supplement with their treating physician, as cases of mania and serotonin syndrome have been reported.",,"SAM-e is endogenously produced from adenosine triphosphate and the amino acid methionine. It is a major, ubiquitous methyl donor to a wide variety of molecules (26), including catecholamines and other biogenic amines, fatty acids, neurotransmitters, nucleic acids, polysaccharides, porphyrins, proteins and membrane phospholipids. Homocysteine is formed through the transsulfuration pathway and is catabolized to cysteine and indirectly to glutathione.
In preclinical models, SAM-e protected against amyloid-beta-induced cellular injury by inhibiting oxidative stress and neuroinflammation (34). It also increased the endogenous antioxidant glutathione and potentiated antioxidant enzyme activity. Supplementation with SAM-e restores hepatic glutathione deposits and attenuates liver injury (26). The mechanism by which SAM-e might treat depression is unknown, but increased synthesis of neurotransmitters such as serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine, may increase responsiveness of neurotransmitter receptors and fluidity of cell membranes in the production of phospholipids (2) (3) (4).",Disulfate Monotosylate,SAM-e | SAMe | SAM | Adomet,SAMe | S-adenosylmethionine | S-Adenosylmethionine,SAMe | SAM-e,SAM-e,

DSI002854,Pomegranate,C4759843,"Pomegranate is a small fruit-bearing tree native to Asia, but it is also cultivated in many parts of the world including the United States. The fruit juice extracted from the arils of the seeds is used in drinks and as a dietary supplement. Several studies suggest antioxidant and antiatherosclerotic properties, which are attributed to the presence of multiple polyphenols such as tannins, flavonols, anthocyanins, and ellagic acid . Preclinical studies also suggest pomegranate juice may suppress inflammatory cell signaling and prostate tumor growth, and lower serum PSA levels . In other experiments, it inhibited aromatase activity, endogenous estrogen biosynthesis, and breast cancer cell proliferation , and a pomegranate seed extract alleviated ciplatin-induced hepatotoxicity in animal studies . Preliminary studies in humans suggest pomegranate may have some benefit on cognition , cardiovascular disease , hyperlipidemia , or erectile dysfunction , but not COPD . Data for its use in hypertension is limited , and meta-analyses did not find pomegranate helpful to improve oxidative stress , although it may help improve some biomarkers of inflammation and vascular dysfunction . A few studies have been conducted in cancer patients. In men with favorable-risk prostate cancer on active surveillance, preliminary data suggest pomegranate fruit extract may alter biomarkers related to androgen signaling and oxidative stress . Pomegranate extract before surgery resulted in pomegranate metabolite accumulation in prostate tissue, but did not significantly lower 8-OHdG levels, a measure of oxidative damage . Data are conflicting on whether pomegranate juice can slow the rate of prostate-specific antigen increase in men with high PSA levels . A planned subset analysis suggests that those with the manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) AA genotype might benefit . Supplementation with a blend of green tea, pomegranate, broccoli, and curcumin resulted in lower rates of PSA increase following PSA relapse post-radical treatment . However, an adjunctive intervention with pomegranate juice in men with advanced prostate cancer did not produce significant PSA reductions versus placebo . Other investigations suggest pomegranate in combination with other plant extracts may modulate gene expression for osteoclastic and osteogenic processes , but intake of pomegranate seed oil did not reduce hot flashes , and there was no overall association between pomegranate juice intake and hormonal biomarkers for breast cancer risk . Pomegranate extract influenced changes in gene expression in colon tissues from colorectal patients . In newly-diagnosed CRC patients, pomegranate consumption may lower plasma LPS-binding protein levels, a marker for endotoxemia . More studies are needed to determine the implications of such changes. Although animal studies suggested pomegranate may inhibit CYP3A and 2C9 , humans studies have not shown clinically relevant interactions .",,"Pomegranate juice has antioxidant and antiatherosclerotic properties due to the presence of polyphenols such as tannins, flavonols, anthocyanins, and ellagic acid. Punicalagin, an ellagitannin, is the most abundant polyphenol that accounts for >50% of antioxidant activity (1) (2).
In animal models, constituents such as ellagic acid and luteolin inhibit ovarian cancer metastasis by downregulating MMP2 and MMP9 (28). In prostate cancer cells, a pomegranate extract induced apoptosis and impaired metastasis also by downregulating MMP2/9 along with TIMP2 upregulation (29). Prevention of chemically-induced mammary carcinogenesis by another extract likely involved anti-inflammatory mechanisms such as differential regulation of NF-κB and NF-erythroid 2p45 (NF-E2)-related factor 2 (Nrf2) signaling (30). Pomegranate extract suppressed breast cancer stem cell characteristics by inhibiting the epithelial to mesenchymal transition (31). It can also inhibit aromatase activity and decrease endogenous estrogen synthesis (5).
Some commercial pomegranate juices are marketed with claims of higher antioxidant activity than green tea and red wine (13). However such effects could be due to colonic microflora metabolites and not the polyphenols present in the juice (14). Recent interest in the link between gut microbiota and cancer explores possible mechanisms. In one RCT, consumption of pomegranate decreased plasma lipopolysaccharide binding protein levels, a known marker associated with onset and development of colorectal cancer (33).","Punica granatum, Fruit | Whole fruit, juice",Chinese apple,Pomegranate,Pomegranate | Pomegranate Oil | Pomegranate protein,Pomegranate,

DSI002944,Chaste tree,C0771966,"The fruit of chasteberry is widely used to relieve premenstrual symptoms and to treat infertility. It is said to have a normalizing action on the menstrual cycle and contain nonsteroidal progestins that can interact with and activate hormone receptors in the body . Chasteberry has opioidergic , dopaminergic , hepatoprotective , and antiproliferative properties in vitro. Clinical studies suggest it can reduce PMS symptoms , but a systematic review highlighted the need for well-designed studies for definitive conclusions . Preliminary data also suggest chasteberry may help reduce mastalgia , but in combination with St. John’s wort, it was ineffective for treating menopausal symptoms . Because chasteberry has phytoestrogenic properties , patients with hormone-sensitive cancers should consult their physicians before using it.",,"In vitro studies have identified several flavonoids in chasteberry, especially casticin, which exerts opioidergic effects through activation of mu- and delta-opioid receptor subtypes (2). Casticin reduced lung inflammation in a murine model by inhibiting numbers of neutrophils, macrophages, and lymphocytes, and by reducing levels of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines (25).
Dopaminergic compounds, particularly clerodadienols, dose-dependently inhibited pituitary prolactin release, which could explain its effect during the premenstrual cycle when serum prolactin levels can be chronically elevated (3). Other diterpenes including rotundifuran also modulate dopamine receptors (14). Linoleic acid from chasteberry binds to estrogen receptors (ER) and can induce certain estrogen genes (12). The flavonoid apigenin was identified as the most active ER isoform-selective phytoestrogen (11), and can also induce progestogenic activity (13).
In human studies, chasteberry restores progesterone concentrations, prolongs the hyperthermic phase in the basal temperature curve, and restores the luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone test to normal. It is thought to act on the pituitary-hypothalamic axis rather than directly on ovaries (11).",,Chasteberry | Vitex | Chaste tree fruit | Monk’s pepper,Chaste tree,,Chasteberry,
DSI002945,Chrysanthemum,C0008720,"Chrysanthemum is a perennial flowering plant from the Asteraceae family that is native to Asia and northeastern Europe. The flower and aerial parts of many species are used in traditional medicine to treat hypertension, angina, fever, and various inflammatory diseases. Preclinical studies have shown cytotoxic , antioxidant , antibacterial , anti-inflammatory , immunomodulatory , antiosteoporotic , and neuroprotective properties. Various species also have antidiabetic , antihyperlipidemic , and anti-atherosclerotic effects. Small studies using chrysanthemum extracts found neuroprotective effects in ischemic stroke patients , reductions in serum uric acid in patients with hyperuricemia , and improvement in knee function in those with osteoarthritis . Chrysanthemum was also found to reverse multidrug resistance in human breast cancer cells , showed anti-angiogenic and antiproliferative effects , and reduced cachexia in a murine model .",,"Antioxidant effects have been attributed to various constituents, including phenolic compounds and chlorogenic acids (18) (38) (39). Anti-inflammatory mechanisms include inhibition of nitric oxide production and tumor necrosis factor-alpha secretion (40). In vitro, anti-osteoporotic activity of phenolic and flavonoid compounds from C. indicum flowers was linked to tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) activity (26). Another C. indicum extract inhibited formation of TRAP-positive mature osteoclasts, disrupted bone resorption, and enhanced primary osteoblast differentiation via upregulation of alkaline phosphatase expression and extracellular calcium concentrations (25). A C. zawadskii ethanol extract inhbited osteoclastogenesis through suppression of ERK activation and other mechanisms to negatively regulate osteoclast differentiation. In diabetes-associated bone disease, C. zawadskii attenuation of dRib-induced cell damage in MC3T3-E1 osteoblastic cells was attributed to antioxidant activity and effects on differentiation related to bone recovery (30).
In animal models, handelin from C. boreale produced anti-inflammatory effects that were linked to downregulation of NF-kappaB signaling and pro-inflammatory cytokine production (23). A polyphenol-rich C. morifolium extract inhibited hyperlipidemic fatty liver in mice through the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-alpha-mediated pathway (33). Chrysanthemum significantly decreased serum IgE, IgG1, IL-4, and IFN-γ levels and reduced mRNA levels of IFN-γ, IL-4, and IL-13 in dorsal skin lesions (16) .
Chrysanthemum reversed multidrug resistance in human breast cancer cells via inhibition of P-glycoprotein activity (15) . It induced apoptosis in various tumor cells via inhibition of JAK1/2 and STAT3 signaling pathways (12) . Antiproliferative effects in lung cancer cells were attributed to suppression of the Akt-dependent signaling pathway by the constituent linarin (37). In animal models, C. morifolium demonstrated anti-cachectic effects by acting as a PPAR-gamma ligand that attenuated skeletal muscle changes in tumor-bearing mice (38).",,Mum | Ju hua | Chu hua | Gujulcho | Kikuka,Chrysanthemum,Chrysanthemum (unspecified) | chrysanthemum | Indian Chrysanthemum,Chrysanthemum,

DSI003014,Chitosan,C0162969,"Chitosan (KY-to-san) is a derivative of chitin, extracted from the exoskeleton of crustaceans, including shrimp, lobster, and clams, and from the cell wall of reishi mushrooms . Chitosan is used as an excipient in pharmaceutical formulations and in biomedical applications including wound dressings. It is also made into an edible film to protect food from spoilage . Chitosan is marketed as an all-natural marine fiber to help manage weight and cholesterol. Animal models suggest antiobesity properties with chitosan and derivative products . In one animal study, a combination of capsaicin and chitosan increased this activity . Findings from human studies are conflicting. Although marketers of weight loss supplements claim chitosan can bind with fat in the intestine, some clinical trials did not find any increase in fecal excretion of fat or weight loss compared with placebo . Other studies have had more positive results in combination with additional products or interventions . Various studies and meta-analyses suggest chitosan may decrease diastolic blood pressure at higher dosages , improve serum lipid profiles , and have some benefit on glycemic regulation . Benefit on weight management are mixed . More trials are needed before definitive conclusions can be drawn. Chitosan may increase total plasma antioxidant activity and lower oxidative stress . Limited clinical data are available regarding efficacy for anemia or chronic renal failure . Reported adverse events include constipation and gastrointestinal distress . Patients allergic to shellfish or mushrooms should use related supplements with caution.",,"Chitosan is a natural polysaccharide that consists of glucosamine and N-acetylglucosamine copolymers (14). It has been described as biodegradable, nontoxic, non-immunogenic, and biocompatible (25), with properties similar to cellulose (2).
In an in vitro study, chitosan demonstrated antioxidant effects by reducing albumin carobonyls and hydroperoxides in a time-dependent manner (9).
In animal models, antiobesity effects may occur through serum leptin and C-reactive protein modulation (14) or AMPK activation and lipogenesis-associated gene inhibition (15). In porcine models, chitosan altered genes influencing appetite and feeding behavior in the small intestine (NPY), adipose tissue (Leptin), and the brain (HCRT, INSR, NMB, GHR, PPARG, NPY5R) (17). It also downregulated FABP2 gene expression, increased serum leptin, and significantly altered gut microbial populations (16). In high-fat diet-induced obese rodents, chitosan oligosaccharides improved dyslipidemia and prevented body weight gain by inhibiting adipocyte differentiation (19). As an insoluble fiber, low molecular weight chitosan polyglucosamines can bind to fat in the intestinal lumen, forming a complex that is partially utilized by colon bacteria and partially eliminated (22) (26) (27), but appropriate concentrations are needed. In one of these animal studies, it was suggested that the more likely mechanisms for weight loss could include bacterial energy wasting, as increased acetate and glucose excretion were also present, suggesting that larger amounts of lipids and glucose were available as fuel for bacteria in the colon (26).
Hypocholesterolemic effects from chitosan in murine models were not due to reduced cholesterol absorption efficiency or increases in fecal sterol output, so that a major bile acid-binding capacity was ruled out (28). The more likely scenario is that the fiber’s influence on satiation and satiety reduces food intake suppression and therefore cholesterol (29).
Human studies suggest that it is unlikely that chitosan binds fat in intestines, and could therefore not support this purported mechanism of action (21) (30).
Topical application enhances wound healing by stimulation of granulation tissue. Possible mechanisms include formation of a gel-like fibronectin matrix that facilitates inward epithelial cell migration and the formation of heparin-chitosan complexes that activate growth factors that bind to stabilized heparin (12).",Shrimp shell,Kitosan | Chitin | Polyglucosamine,Chitosan,Chitosan,Chitosan,

DSI003084,Andrographolide,C0051821,"Andrographis paniculata is a bitter tasting annual plant prevalent in much of Asia. It is often used in combination with other herbs in traditional medicine to treat infectious diseases and associated fevers. It is also used in folk medicine to treat snakebites. Andrographis is promoted in supplemental form for cancer prevention or treatment, and to counter chemotherapy toxicity in humans. Formulations containing standardized extracts of andrographis are also marketed for colds and flu. Preclinical studies suggest antimicrobial , anti-inflammatory , antioxidant , anticancer properties. Kan Jang, a standardized extract of A. paniculata and Eleutherococcus senticosus, has been studied in manufacturer-sponsored clinical trials for relief of respiratory symptoms from cold and flu , and may help reduce severity and recovery time . An andrographis extract also appeared helpful for upper respiratory infections and meta-analyses suggest possible benefit to reduce cough frequency and severity . Andrographis has also been evaluated for ulcerative colitis. In one trial, those receiving A. paniculata extract at higher doses were more likely to achieve a clinical response compared with placebo , and another study found it as effective as mesalamine . Other preliminary data suggest andrographis extracts can reduce rheumatoid factors and arthritis symptoms . In patients with modest hypertriglyceridemia, reduced triglyceride levels with a high-dose andrographis extract were comparable to reductions with gemfibrozil . In a pilot study of patients with not-active progressive multiple sclerosis, andrographolide appeared safe and showed trends in reducing brain atrophy rates and disability progression .",,"The active constituents of andrographis are diterpenoid lactones known as andrographolides (10) (11). They exhibit anti-inflammatory activity by inhibiting NO production and COX-2 expression (26). In mouse hepatocytes, andrographis induced mRNA expression of CYP1A1 and 1A2 in a concentration-dependent manner (31). In other studies, andrographis extract demonstrated a calcium channel inhibition effect that could cause smooth muscle relaxation, decreased blood pressure and heart rate (32), and relaxation of the uterus (33). It also showed antiplatelet effects by inhibiting thrombin (34) and platelet activating factor (35). When given orally to mice, andrographis extract neutralized snake venom (9).
In other preclinical studies, activity against multiple myeloma cells may occur via TLR4/NF-kappaB signaling pathway inhibition (52). In human colorectal cancer cells, reversal of 5-FU resistance was attributed to elevated BAX expression (50). Migration and invasion was inhibited through suppression of mRNA and MMP-7 protein levels (13), while MMP-2 activity was also identified (14). Inhibition of IL-6 expression and IL-6-mediated signals occurred in human prostate cancer cells (12). In non-small cell lung cancer cells andrographolides reduced invasiveness by suppressing the PI3K/Akt/AP-1 signaling pathway and inhibiting MMP-7 expression (15). Apoptosis in human hepatoma cells occurred via c-Jun N-terminal kinase induction (16) and caspase activation (17). Decreased adhesion of gastric cancer cells to endothelial tissue was attributed to inhibition of E-selection expression (18). Inhibition of tumor cell growth may also occur by stimulating cytotoxic T-lymphocyte production via IL-2 and IFN-gamma secretion (19). Andrographolides also enhanced doxorubicin-induced cell death in several human cancer cell lines, mainly through JAK-STAT suppression (20).
In HIV patients, andrographolides inhibited HIV-induced cell-cycle dysregulation and increased CD4+ lymphocyte levels (10).",Aerial parts | Aerial parts,Indian Echinacea | Chuan Xin Lian | Chiretta | Kalmegh,Andrographolide | Andrographis Paniculata Extract,Andrographolide | Andrographis,Andrographis,

DSI003104,Ginger,C2740621,"Derived from the rhizome of the plant, ginger is native to Asia and used as food and medicine. In traditional Chinese medicine, ginger is used to expel “cold”, “wind” and “dampness”, and is believed to stop the reverse flow of Qi (energy) . Western use has been primarily for gastrointestinal symptoms and respiratory ailments. Preclinical studies indicate that ginger has antiemetic , anticancer , anti-inflammatory , anti-drug-dependence , and hypoglycemic effects . It may also protect against Alzheimer’s disease . Ginger influences gastric emptying in healthy individuals and may promote feelings of satiety . Data suggest its effectiveness for treating dysmenorrhea , as well as moderate efficacy against osteoarthritic and chronic low back pain . As an adjunct to standard care, ginger may also be beneficial for treating migraine . Although clinical trials indicate that ginger can reduce nausea and vomiting, it should be avoided perioperatively due to anticoagulant/antiplatelet effects , and during pregnancy since animal studies highlight concerns regarding embryo development . Dietary ginger seems to be without these effects , although some studies suggest that high concentrations of fresh ginger have antiplatelet effects . In oncology settings, ginger may prevent chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) , but a systemic review cited the need for further research . Another study suggested that adjuvant ginger supplementation may improve CIN-related quality of life and cancer-related fatigue . The bioactive compound 6-gingerol may also improve overall CINV, appetite, and quality of life . However other studies did not show benefit with ginger as an adjunct to CINV prophylaxis , or in patients receiving high-dose cisplatin except in female and head and neck cancer subgroups . Supplementation may have chemopreventive effects for those at increased risk for colon cancer with normal-appearing colonic mucosa . Larger studies are needed to confirm potential benefits of ginger supplementation for symptom control or for chemoprevention. Other studies report ginger aromatherapy to be useful in reducing nausea and vomiting in postoperative patients , but data on CINV are mixed .",,"Antiemetic actions are attributed to shogaol and gingerol compounds present in the rhizome, which stimulate flow of saliva, bile, and gastric secretions, and galanolactone, which can act as a competitive antagonist at serotonin 5-HT3 receptors (2) (22). Additional activities include stimulation of antral contractions, reduction of postprandial antral area, and acceleration of gastric emptying (13). Ginger inhibits thromboxane formation and platelet aggregation (43). However, these effects appear to be dose- and formulation-dependent (eg, dried, fresh, or extract) (31).
In vitro studies suggest that fresh ginger stimulates mucosal cells to secrete IFN-β to combat viral infection (32), while certain ginger preparations reduced lipopolysaccharide-induced secretion of IL-8 in human bronchial epithelial cells (8), and inhibited human telomerase reverse transcriptase and c-Myc expression in human lung cancer cells (44).
In other studies, gingerol induced apoptosis of gastric cancer cells through TRAIL-dependent caspase 3/7 activation (3) and inhibited cell-cycle progression by reducing cyclin D1 expression (4). It also inhibited secretion of angiogenic cytokines such as VEGF and IL-8 in ovarian cancer cells (5). In animal models, shogaol reduced tumor growth by damaging microtubules and by inducing mitotic arrest (3). Increased levels of circulating antioxidant and phase II enzymes and reduced lipid peroxidation levels are mechanisms by which ginger might protect against DMH-induced colon cancers (45).",Zingiber officinale - Rhizome,Ginger root | Shen jiang,Ginger,African Ginger | Ginger | Spiked Ginger Lily,Ginger,

DSI003163,Castor oil,C0007343,"Castor oil is a thick, odorless oil extracted from the bean of the tropical flowering shrub Ricinus communis. It has been historically used to relieve constipation, stomach aches, colds, fever, as an eye lotion, and to induce labor. Currently it is used as a laxative and as an emollient in cosmetics and personal care products, drug delivery systems and wound dressings . Castor oil is approved by the FDA for safe and effective use as a stimulant laxative.In preclinical studies castor oil demonstrated antioxidant, antimicrobial, antiviral, anti-inflammatory, wound-healing, antinociceptive and cytotoxic effects . Limited clinical data suggest benefits for eye diseases , knee osteoarthritis and a meta-analysis determined it can potentially improve the completion rate (CR) and polyp detection rate in colon capsule endoscopy (CCE). The authors suggest it should be actively considered as a viable component for bowel preparation alongside other emerging laxative regimens . Studies also support use of castor oil for inducing labor .Castor oil and CancerCenturies ago, castor oil was among the treatment options for breast cancer that was attributed to an excess of black bile by the Greek physicians Hippocrates and Galen . Castor oil packs were also popularized in the 1920s by Edgar Cayce, a self-proclaimed psychic and faith healer, to eradicate tumors near the breast surface .More recently, a castor plant fruit extract showed antiproliferative activity against breast cancer cell lines in vitro and a castor oil extract had a suppressive effect on S180 body tumors and ascites tumors in murine models . According to a case report, a formulation containing Balsam Peru, trypsin and hydrogenated castor oil accelerated wound healing in a breast cancer patient following radical mastectomy . But there are no studies in humans that show castor oil has anti-cancer effects.",,"Pharmacological studies revealed the main constituent ricinoleic acid to be responsible for the laxative effects of castor oil by influencing intestinal ion transport, water flux, and intestinal motility – through activation of EP3 and EP4 prostanoid receptors in smooth muscle cells. Research is needed to determine how castor oil induces labor (14).",Seed(s) | Graines de ricinus communis,Palm of Christ | Palma Christi | Ricinus oil | Oleum Ricini | Castorbean Oil,Castor oil | Oleum ricini,Castor oil derivative (unspecified) | Castor Oil | Ethoxylated Castor Oil | Polyoxyl Castor Oil,Castor Oil,

DSI003184,Dandelion,C0877851,"Dandelion is related to the daisy family and commonly found worldwide. The flower, leaf and root of this plant are used in traditional medicine for their diuretic, cholagogic, antirheumatic and appetite-stimulating properties . In Chinese Medicine, the herb has been used to promote lactation. It is also used to reduce abscesses, especially in the breast and intestines . In vitro and in vivo studies suggest that dandelion has lipid-lowering , hepatoprotective , antiviral , anticoagulant , diuretic , anti-inflammatory , and antioxidant activities. A polyherbal extract containing dandelion was reported effective against acute non-bacterial tonsillitis in children . Dandelion root extract demonstrated anticancer effects against melanoma and leukemia , as well as pancreatic and colorectal cancer cell lines. It also showed estrogenic activity. Preclinical studies suggest increased proliferation of hormone-sensitive breast cancer cells as well as increased uterine weight in immature female rats . In addition, it can cause allergic reactions and may interact with some prescription drugs. There have been a few case reports of potential benefit in patients with blood cancers , but it is unclear whether this was definitively due to dandelion supplementation. Clinical trials are needed to determine the conditions under which dandelion may be safe and effective.",,"The diuretic activity of dandelion may be a result of its high potassium content (23). In murine models of diet-induced fatty liver disease, dandelion leaf extract exihibited hepatoprotective effects with decreased serum levels of ALT, hepatic TG, and MDA, as well as TNF-alpha and IL-6 expression (14). At the post-transcriptional level, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties were exihibited via decreased activation of procaspase-3 to active caspase-3, and JNK phosphorylation (14). Linoleic acid, phytol and tetracosanol have been identified as bioactive compounds, with hypolipidemic effects occurring via AMP-activated protein kinase activation in human HepG2 cells (13).
Dandelion has been shown to decrease human hepatoma cell line viability by increasing tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-1alpha production (9). Other research has shown that the presence of luteolin and luteolin 7-glucoside in dandelion flower extract exhibits cytotoxic activities against the colon adenocarcinoma cell line (Caco-2) (4). An isolated compound identical to lupeol, a lupane-type triterpene, inhibited cell growth and induced melanogenesis in a mouse melanoma cell line (3). 
Sesquiterpene lactones are thought to be the allergenic compounds in dandelion (7).",,Blowball | Puffball | Lion's tooth | Pu gong ying | Swine snout | Wild endive,Dandelion,Dandelion,Dandelion,

DSI003257,Indole-3-carbinol,C0063491,"Indole-3-Carbinol (I3C) is a phytochemical derived from the breakdown of glucosinolates found in cruciferous vegetables including Brussels sprouts, kale, broccoli, cabbage, and cauliflower . Epidemiologic studies suggest that a diet high in cruciferous vegetables is associated with protective effects and lower cancer risk .Preclinical studies suggest antimicrobial , anti-inflammatory , anti-estrogenic , and antiangiogenic effects. Potential activity against human breast , prostate , melanoma , endometrial , liver , and pancreatic cancer cells , as well as animal models of lung , laryngeal , and nasopharyngeal carcinoma have also been exhibited. In addition, preliminary experiments suggest I3C may enhance effects of vorinostat , bortezomib , tamoxifen , doxorubicin , vemurafenib , fludarabine , gemcitabine , or acetylsalicylic acid , and may reverse toxicities of dexamethasone or doxorubicin . However, these effects have not been confirmed in humans and some models suggest that I3C may also promote tumor growth . Additional studies are needed to determine under what conditions I3C could be a suitable chemopreventive agent in humans.Data from early phase clinical trials suggested that I3C is effective against precancerous cervical dysplasia and vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia . In premenopausal women, a supplement containing I3C and 7-hydroxymatairesinol, a dietary ingredient, increased the urinary 2:16-hydroxyestrone ratio, a known biomarker for the reduction of breast cancer risk . More recently, an RCT of a diindolylmethane formulation (DIM, an active I3C metabolite) in breast cancer patients on tamoxifen suggest it encourages beneficial changes in estrogen metabolism and circulating sex hormone-binding globulin levels .I3C is generally well tolerated when taken orally, but it is unclear if I3C supplementation can benefit humans due to its mixed effects in preliminary studies and its ability to induce cytochrome P450 enzymes , which may cause interactions with several medications. In addition, a recent study to measure Brassica consumption in humans suggests that the chemopreventive effects derived from cruciferous vegetable consumption may plateau and not require eating large quantities or taking high-dose supplements .",,"I3C is derived from the breakdown of glucobrassicin produced in cruciferous vegetables (39). Some health-protective effects are attributed to epigenetic mechanisms (63). I3C counteracted HPV16 immune evasion by antagonizing E6 repression of E-cadherin (64). It decreased proinflammatory cytokine production and T-cell activation by acting as histone deacetylase class I inhibitors (31). Hepatoprotective mechanisms include immunomodulation and inhibition of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines (66), decreased miR-31 expression, and subsequent T-cell apoptosis (32).In cancer cells, I3C at higher doses induced apoptosis, while lower doses inhibited cell growth and cyclin E and CDK2 expression (27). Antiproliferative effects may occur by regulating microRNAs that regulate gene expression (65) and upregulation of apoptotic enzymes (48). Other observed activities include estrogen receptor modulation (15) (34) and reductions in MMP-2/9 and aromatase expression (16) (36) (37). In lung carcinoma cells, I3C induced G0/G1 apoptosis and cell cycle arrest (12). In gemcitabine-resistant pancreatic cancer cells, chemosensitizing occurred via downregulated microRNA-21 (43), lower LD50 of gemcitabine, and reactivation of the p16INK4a tumor suppressor gene (19). In melanoma cells, G1 apoptosis/arrest occurred via stabilization of wild-type PTEN expression (39). In prostate cancer cells, I3C inhibits Akt activation, androgen-dependent pathways, and inflammation (8) (38). In murine models, it reduced proinflammatory and procarcinogenic proteins (44).I3C coadministration with doxorubicin potentiated cytotoxic effects compared with either agent alone in pre-B acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells (49). Along with vorinostat, it modulated re-expression of critical receptors in certain triple negative breast cancer subtypes (69). I3C with genistein produced synergy of apoptosis and TRAIL in endometrial cancer cells (40). It reversed dexamethasone cytotoxicity via ROS inhibition and enhanced Nrf2 expression (54).Some animal studies suggest that I3C is both an inhibitor and promoter of carcinogenesis with strong induction of placental glutathione S-transferase foci in the liver (57), and modulatory activity that included apoptotic inhibition in colon tumors (55). In addition, I3C may promote endometrial adenocarcinoma through hepatic CYP1 induction and estrogen metabolism modulation (56).","Synthetic | Indole-3-carbinol | Broccoli, Brussels sprouts, cabbage, cauliflower, collards, kale, kohlrabi, mustard greens, rapeseed, rutabaga, turnips",I3C | Indole-3-methanol | 3-(Hydroxymethyl)indole | 3-Indolylcarbinol | Indolylmethanol,Indole-3-carbinol | Indole-3-Carbinol,Indole-3-Carbinol (I3C),Indole-3-Carbinol,

DSI003263,Pueraria,C3540829,"Kudzu is a botanical used in traditional medicine to treat alcoholism, cardiovascular disease, menopausal symptoms, diabetes, fever, the common cold, and neck or eye pain. There are several species of kudzu and both the flowers and root extract are used for their medicinal properties. Isoflavones, the major components of kudzu, are thought to be responsible for its potential effects. In vitro, kudzu has demonstrated antiproliferative , anti-inflammatory , and neuroprotective properties. In animal studies, feeding with kudzu root suppressed alcohol intake and withdrawal symptoms . Studies of kudzu in humans are limited and have mostly focused on its effects on alcohol consumption or climacteric symptoms. In heavy drinkers, data suggest kudzu may be a useful adjunct to reduce alcohol intake . In moderate drinkers, it was shown to not disturb sleep wake/cycles, as can occur during withdrawal or with other medications that treat dependence . In another small study, a single dose of kudzu extract reduced alcohol consumption . Other preliminary studies suggest kudzu may improve symptoms such as hot flushes and night sweats in perimenopausal women , and cognitive function in postmenopausal women . Although a topical P. mirifica gel improved vaginal symptoms in postmenopausal women, a conjugated estrogen cream was found to be more effective . A recent systematic review of P. mirifica regarding efficacy for menopausal symptoms is inconclusive . In addition, another systematic review determined that evidence on benefits for any condition with various species of kudzu are limited and unclear . Because human and animal studies suggest some estrogenic effects , individuals with hormone-sensitive cancers and those taking tamoxifen should avoid kudzu.",,"Anti-inflammatory properties are attributed to decreased prostaglandin E2 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha release, both of which are involved in inflammatory processes (3). The isoflavone tectorigenin demonstrated antiproliferative activity via cell differentiation and reduced expression of Bcl-2, an antiapoptotic protein (1). In animal studies, peurarin may alleviate chronic alcoholic liver injury via inhibition of endotoxin gut-leakage, activation of Kupffer cells, and expression of lipopolysaccharide receptors (22).
In humans, benefits from kudzu on hot flashes, night sweats, and cognitive function are also attributed to isoflavones (5) (6). Puerarin particularly has been credited with influencing alcohol consumption patterns, although the mechanism by which this might occur is unknown (19).",Root | Root,Pueraria | Pueraria root | Ge Gen | Kudsu | Japanese arrowroot,Pueraria omeiensis | Pueraria Montana Var. thomsonii,Kudzu | Mealy Kudzu,Kudzu,

DSI003313,Resveratrol,C0073096,"Resveratrol is a polyphenolic compound found in many botanical products. Red wine is a natural source of resveratrol as it is rich in grape skin and seeds. However, resveratrol is usually consumed as a dietary supplement for its purported antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. It is also marketed as an anti-aging supplement based on findings that it prolongs the life span of yeast cells . This effect has not yet been demonstrated in humans. A long-term randomized double-blind trial indicates that resveratrol and its major metabolites penetrate the blood-brain barrier to have effects on some biomarkers associated with Alzheimer’s disease , but a meta-analysis did not find any significant effect on memory or cognitive performance . Recent double-blind trials have also not found benefit with resveratrol on cognitive function in older adults . In a long-term trial in postmenopausal women, resveratrol improved chronic pain, somatic menopausal symptoms, circulatory function, and well-being . Additional data suggest potential bone-protective effects . But resveratrol was ineffective in reducing hormonal migrane burden in premenopausal women . Resveratrol has also been evaluated for cardioprotective effects. Earlier studies found it reduces low density lipoprotein oxidation, inhibits platelet aggregation, and may protect against atherogenesis . Consumption of wine or a resveratrol-rich grape supplement is associated with reduced risk of cardiovascular disease and may help promote circulatory system health . However, a meta-analysis did not find benefit with resveratrol supplementation on cardiovascular risk factors , it does not decrease risk of all-cause mortality in older adults , and higher doses may increase biomarker levels for cardiovascular disease risk . Resveratrol did not increase exercise capacity in patients with fatty acid oxidation (FAO) disorders and data on its effectiveness against non-alcoholic fatty liver disease are conflicting . But a formulation containing resveratrol may lower the risk of cardiovascular diseases in overweight and obese pediatric cases . Studies on resveratrol for diabetic patients are mixed , and a Cochrane review determined there is currently insufficient evidence for its use in diabetes . Data on whether it controls metabolic syndrome in obese subjects are also inconclusive , and resveratrol had no effect on insulin sensitivity or on hepatic or cardiovascular indices in overweight adults. Other studies suggest benefit with resveratrol in diabetic patients on bone density and levels of SIRT-1, a key protein in metabolism and inflammation . It may also help as adjunctive therapy to improve symptoms in rheumatoid and osteoarthritis . Preclinical experiments suggest that resveratrol has antiproliferative and antioxidant effects . In combination with radiation exposure, it exhibited dose-dependent radioprotective , radiomodulatory , radiosensitizing , cytotoxic , and neuroprotective effects. Other experiments suggest effects including chemotherapeutic potentiation and protection against chemo-induced cardiotoxicity . However, data on use of resveratrol in cancer patients are quite limited. In phase 1 pilots of colorectal cancer patients, one study suggests resveratrol may decrease tumor cell proliferation while another suggests utility may be limited to prevention rather than established cancers . Study of a high-dose micronized formula in multiple myeloma patients was stopped due to serious adverse events that included renal failure . In addition, resveratrol exhibits estrogen-like properties and activates transcription by both estrogen and androgen receptors that can lead to the stimulation of cancer cell proliferation . Therefore, larger well-designed trials are needed to determine the circumstances under which resveratrol might demonstrate safety and utility. Whereas resveratrol appears to be well tolerated in some studies, high doses can cause gastrointestinal side effects such as diarrhea . It also inhibits CYP450 enzymes and may increase the risk of adverse effects of certain drugs. Given its phytoestrogenic properties and potential for interactions, use of this supplement should be discussed with the treating physician.",,"Resveratrol acts as an antioxidant and inhibits LDL oxidation (21), platelet aggregation, and eicosanoid synthesis (4). It also induces nitric oxide production (24) (25) and increases arterial blood flow (8). These actions may contribute to its purported cardiovascular health benefits. Resveratrol acts as an anti-inflammatory agent by inhibiting cyclooxygenase activity (26). It has been shown to decrease C-reactive protein and tumor necrosis factor, and increase anti-inflammatory IL-10 and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 in humans (5). Decreases in oxidative stress and improved insulin sensitivity may occur via increased protein kinase activities (10). Resveratrol also decreased circulating insulin-like growth factor-1 and IGF-binding protein-3 levels (27) which may account for its antidiabetic effects observed in some studies. Preliminary data suggest that it increases the life span of yeast cells by activating sirtuins (1) (2), and inhibiting human Sirt3 along with stimulating Sirt5 and Sirt1 (28). Neuroprotective effects may occur via regulating autophagy and apoptosis mediated by the Akt/mTOR pathway (51).
Resveratrol has also been investigated for its anticancer potential. It inhibited cancer cell proliferation via apoptosis and antiestrogenic effects (14) (15) (16) (17). Trans-resveratrol appears to decrease methylation of the tumor suppressor gene RASSF-1alpha in women at increased of risk breast cancer (29). Reductions in breast cancer cell migration and invasion have been observed (30) (31), and resveratrol growth factor heregulin-beta1 mediated MMP9 expression (30). However, contradictory data show that resveratrol mimics phytoestrogens and could activate genes that are normally regulated by estrogens or androgens (18) (19). In other studies resveratrol helped reduce prostate tumorigenesis through reduced prostatic levels of mTOR complex 1 activity and increased expression of SIRT1 (32). It modulates steroid hormone-dependent pathways to inhibit prostate cancer cell growth; however it also increases angiogenesis and inhibits apoptosis in vivo (19).
Additional findings show that resveratrol downregulates p21 and upregulates cyclin E leading to S-phase accumulation and apoptosis in neuroblastoma cells (14). It also inhibits CYP1A1, 1A2, and 1B1 enzymes in tumor cells, perhaps exerting antitumor effects as some of these enzymes are known to be involved in the activation of procarcinogens and toxins (22) (23). Protective effects of resveratrol against doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity are due to upregulation of SIRT1-mediated p53 deacetylation (20). Also, it protects against cisplatin-induced cardiotoxicity by suppressing oxidative stress (19).","Vitis vinifera, Fruit |

DSI003389,Lavender,C0524903,"Derived from the flowering tops of the plant, lavender is used in lotions, perfumes, and in aromatherapy. It also has a long history as an herbal remedy in traditional medicine to improve mood and as a sleep aid. Preclinical data suggest anxiolytic , anticonvulsant , neuroprotective , cardioprotective , antimicrobial , anti-inflammatory , and antioxidant effects. In dementia models, lavender oil inhalation reversed spatial memory loss . Studies in humans of both oral formulas and lavender aromatherapy have been conducted. Clinical trials suggest benefit with oral lavender preparations against depression and anxiety . Studies of lavender aromatherapy suggest it may help reduce preoperative anxiety as well as postoperative analgesics and various types of pain , but it did not lower anxiety during radiotherapy . Other studies of inhaled lavender found improvements in sleep quality , post-acute-stress memory and physiologic function , dysmenorrhea and emotional symptoms , premenstrual syndrome , menopause flushing , migraine frequency , agitation and falls in older individuals and dementia symptoms . Various meta-analyses suggest benefit with either oral lavender or aromatherapy for anxiety and menopausal symptoms, but additional high-quality studies are needed to confirm safety and efficacy . Aromatherapy massage with lavender improved psychological and physiological responses in patients with acute coronary syndrome , but did not enhance the benefits of massage in a hospice setting . Preclinical studies suggest anticancer effects of lavender against various cancer cell lines . Animal studies that employed the monocyclic terpene perillyl alcohol (POH) derived from several herbs including lavender showed tumor inhibition and regression , but studies in humans are needed.",,"Anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects of lavender are attributed to 1,8-cineole (2). Other major constituents include linalool and linalyl acetate, which may relax blood vessels and induce anxiolytic effects (30) (40) (54). In a murine model, exposure to linalool odor induced anxiolytic effects without motor impairment (77).
Lavender oil also has broad-spectrum antibacterial activity (22). It reversed bacterial resistance to piperacillin in multi-drug-resistant E.coli via alterations of outer membrane permeability and bacterial quorum sensing inhibition (27); and prevented immediate-type allergic reactions by inhibiting mast cell degranulation (25). Antimicrobial activity was synergistic or additive when combined with other essential oils, with the most favorable combinations being cinnamon or sweet orange oil against C. albicans and S. aureus, respectively (28).
In addition, lavender has CNS depressive effects (3). In animal models, it attenuated neuronal damage, and upregulated catalase, superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, and the glutathione/glutathione disulfide ratio (21). Activity in stroke models include increased endogenous antioxidant defense, oxidative stress inhibition, and increased VEGF expression (33). In an Alzheimer’s disease model, lavender extract improved spatial performance by diminishing beta-amyloid production in the hippocampus (32). In mice with anosmia, anxiolytic effects with lavender inhalation were likely due to serotonergic mechanisms rather than olfactory activation (30) (31). However, whether lavender alleviates or exacerbates anxiety may actually be determined by genetic influences on temperament as these behaviors were amplified after exposure to lavender inhalation in calm versus nervous sheep (56). Antiepileptic effects are due to suppressed nitric oxide levels in the brain (26). Cardioprotective effects are attributed to lavender’s antioxidant properties (35). In wound healing models, lavender oil accelerated re-epithelialization and wound closure via enhanced epidermal growth factor secretion (55).
In young women with premenstrual syndrome, lavender inhalation increased the high frequency component of heart rate variability, reflecting parasympathetic nervous system activity (37). Although lavender reduced anxiety during urodynamic assessments by increasing gamma-aminobutyric acid inhibitory effects in the amygdala, blood pressure increases were attributed to potential diuretic activity (40). A positron emission tomography study revealed anxiolytic effects may occur via reduced serotonin-1A receptor binding (41). Effects on preoperative anxiety were attributed to both the use of lavender aroma as well as the placebo effect of added attention to patients (68).
An aqueous lavender extract inhibited lymphocyte proliferation in Hodgkin’s lymphoma cell lines via apoptosis (47). In addition, lavender extracts and essential oil exhibited cytotoxicity in malignant cells, upregulated Bax expression, and induced PARP cleavage in HeLa cells, and caused a sub-G1 peak in treated cells compared with controls (48). Perillyl alcohol (POH), derived from botanicals including lavender, may affect transforming growth factor-beta and/or Ras signaling pathways (59) and Na/K-ATPase inhibition (60).
Lavender oil has weak estrogenic and antiandrogenic activities that could alter estrogen and androgen signaling pathways (14).",Flower,Aspic | Lavandin | Spike lavender,Lavendula angustifolia (Lavender) flower/leaf/stem,Lavender | Lavandula (unspecified),Lavender,

DSI003458,Astragalus,C1095897,"Astragalus belongs to a group of medicinal plants in the Leguminosae family. The root of A. membranaceus has a long history of use in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), and is often used along with other herbs as a tonic to increase stamina, strength, and vitality. Extracts of astragalus are sold as dietary supplements to improve immune function and to decrease fatigue. Beneficial effects of astragalus are attributed to its polysaccharides and triterpenoid saponin compounds. Preclinical studies indicate that astragalus and its constituents have antioxidant , anti-inflammatory , and antiviral properties, along with exerting protective effects on the heart , kidney , bones , and the nervous system . In small studies involving healthy individuals, astragalus exhibited sodium-excreting properties ; produced a viral-type immune response ; and attenuated immune-suppression induced by strenuous physical activity . A formula containing astragalus decreased fatigue in athletes ; reduced diabetic ketoacidosis ; and as an adjuvant therapy, helped manage fatigue in stroke patients . In the injectable form, astragalus may benefit patients with IgA nephropathy . In addition, an astragalus-based formula was shown to preserve residual renal function in dialysis patients , and to reduce proteinuria associated with idiopathic membranous nephropathy . Systematic reviews reported benefits of astragalus as an adjunctive therapy for short-term reductions of albuminuria, proteinuria, and serum creatinine in patients with diabetic kidney disease ; and for improving quality of life in those with intracranial hemorrhage . Further research is needed to determine long-term safety and efficacy . Astragalus also showed anticancer effects against gastric , colon , hepatic and ovarian cancer cells, and concomitant treatment with aldesleukin potentiated tumoricidal activity while decreasing side effects . In addition, it enhanced platinum-based chemotherapy and protected against oxaliplatin neurotoxicity . Its saponins were shown to reverse fluorouracil-associated toxicity , and augmented benefits of vinblastine while reducing its neutropenic and anemic effects . Limited clinical data suggest astragalus may be useful in managing cancer-related fatigue . It has also been associated with prolonged survival times in acute myeloid leukemia patients ; and may help reverse chemo-induced immunosuppression along with reducing chemo-induced side effects . Meta-analyses have shown associations between astragalus and reductions in chemo-induced nausea and vomiting , chemo-induced gastrointestinal toxicity , radiation-induced lung injury and improvements in quality of life in patients with hepatocellular cancers . However, the majority of studies included in these analyses were limited by poor methodology. Larger, well-designed trials are needed to confirm the findings . Additionally, the injectable forms of astragalus were shown to improve clinical outcomes in liver cancer patients ; and quality of life in patients with advanced and metastatic cancers . Whether orally administered astragalus exerts similar effects is not known. Although astragalus is considered generally safe, due to its antioxidant and estrogenic activities, it may interfere with certain chemotherapy drugs and/or affect hormone-sensitive cancers. However, these findings are based on preclinical studies and cannot be extrapolated to clinical recommendations. The physiological concentration used in these studies is unlikely to be achieved in humans, which makes it difficult to predict the downstream effects/interactions.",,"Polysaccharides, triterpenoid saponins, and flavonoids are the main constituents of astragalus with immunomodulating, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anticancer effects (27) (51). In vitro studies suggest the saponin astragaloside I promotes osteoblastic differentiation by regulating the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway (36). Cardioprotective effects from astragaloside IV may occur via the notch1/hes1 signaling pathway (30). In addition, it augments fibrinolytic potential via increases in tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) synthesis and downregulation of PA inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1) (21). Other anticoagulant activities are attributed to upregulation of KLF2 mRNA expression and inhibition of NF-kB signaling pathway (52).
Polysaccharides isolated from astragalus produce immunomodulating effects via activation of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)-related mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activities (53). In murine models, they reduced colitis via inhibition of NOD-like receptor protein 3 inflammasome, which decreases inflammatory factors such as interleukin (IL)-18 and IL-1beta (54), and reduced multiorgan iron overload via upregulated hepcidin and IL-6 expression and enhanced p38 MAPK phosphorylation (55). Cardioprotective effects with this constituent were attributed to anti-inflammatory properties and improved balance between reactive oxygen species (ROS) and NO (32). In a diabetic rat model, astragalus polysaccharides exerted effects on glucose and lipid metabolism and insulin resistance (37). Astragalus was also found to reduce the secretion of inflammatory cytokines via increasing levels of CD4+ CD25+ Foxp3+ T cells and by inhibiting the activation of NF-κB (61).
Benefits to counteract memory disorders were seen with astragalus due to its activity as a nerve-growth promoting factor (17) and due to its ability to increase M-cholinergic receptor density in senile rats (11).
In dialysis patients, an astragalus-based TCM formula enhanced NO production and transforming growth factor beta suppression (40). In IgA nephropathy patients, an astragalus injection decreased Core I β3-Gal-T-specific molecular chaperone (Cosmc) gene expression and increased IgA1 O-glycosylation levels (26). In healthy individuals, a sublingual/ingested astragalus root extract produced increases in monocytes, neutrophils, lymphocytes, and platelets, as well as circulating cytokines levels, and self-reported symptoms similar to viral type immune responses such as fatigue, malaise, and headache (38). In another study, a formula containing astragalus reduced fatigue in athletes by increasing the uptake and utility of oxygen (10).
Mechanisms by which astragalus and its constituents may exert anticancer effects have also been examined. In human colorectal cancers cell lines, astragalus suppressed chromosome organization, histone modification, and regulation of macromolecule metabolism, as well as several cancer signaling pathways (56). Saponins induced S phase and G2/M arrest and suppressed p21 expression and cyclin-dependent kinase activity (42). Modulation of mTOR signaling and COX2 downregulation also occurred, which in turn can reduce VEGF levels to suppress angiogenesis (43). In gastric adenocarcinoma cells, caspase 3 activation, G2/M phase cell cycle arrest, cyclin B1, p21 and c-myc regulation, and downregulation of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and MMP-9 occurred (41). Combined with vinblastine, saponins boosted downregulation of proangiogenic and proliferative factors while attenuating neutropenia and anemia seen with this chemotherapy (44). In combination with calpain inhibitors, these saponins may also exert more pronounced apoptotic effects (45). Polysaccharides potentiate immune-mediated antitumor activity of interleukin-2 in vitro (13), improve lymphocyte responses, enhance natural killer cell activity, potentiate monocyte activity (14), increase phagocytosis perhaps by regulating tumor necrosis factor production (5), and activate macrophages to release nitric oxie and tumor necrosis factor-alpha, which directly blocks growth of breast cancer cells (62). Apoptotic effects by polysaccharides in hepatocellular carcimona cells were attributed to decreased Notch1 expression (46).
Formononetin derived from astragalus was shown to have estrogen-receptor-modulating effects (50). Angiogenic effects of astragaloside IV appear to be synergized when combined with ferulic acid from Angelica sinsensis (57).",Dried root(s) | Leaves,Huang chi | Huang qi | Milk vetch | Radix astragali,Astragalus | Astragalus menziesii,Astragalus,Astragalus,

DSI003519,Ginkgo,C0872895,"Ginkgo biloba is one of the oldest living tree species. It is cultivated around the world for its medicinal properties and aesthetic value. The seeds and leaves have been used in traditional Chinese medicine to treat respiratory diseases, circulatory disorders, sexual dysfunction, and hearing loss. It is also marketed as a supplement to support memory and circulation.Clinical studies including the large Ginkgo Evaluation of Memory (GEM) study generally show supplementation with ginkgo does not improve cognitive performance or prevent Alzheimer’s disease or dementia . In addition, positive effects from earlier studies were not confirmed in more recent trials and some systematic reviews determined there was insufficient evidence on any benefits in adults with either normal cognition or mild cognitive impairment .Although two trials suggest potential benefit with ginkgo in acute ischemic stroke , a study in older adults noted increased stroke incidence , and a meta-analysis suggests evidence is generally weak with a high risk of bias . In addition, the large GEM study did not find benefit with ginkgo for cardiovascular disease incidence or mortality . Studies on whether ginkgo can help tinnitus are mixed , as are studies for other conditions such as ADHD .Studies on ginkgo in cancer patients are quite limited , and secondary outcome data from the aforementioned GEM study does not support the use of ginkgo to reduce cancer risk . It is also ineffective in preventing chemotherapy-associated cognitive dysfunction in breast cancer patients .Although some preliminary data suggested ginkgo may reduce ovarian cancer risk , animal models suggest that high doses may have hepatocarcinogenic effects . More studies are needed to determine the significance of these findings.",,"Ginkgo interacts with several cytochrome P450 enzymes. Pretreatment with G. biloba extract induces expression of CYP3A proteins and mRNA and increases CYP3A activity (26). It also inhibits CYP2B6 catalytic activity and bupropion hydroxylation (27). Ginkgo may play a role in decreasing high-glucose-induced endothelial inflammation via inhibition of interleukin-6 activation (28), and repeated intake of ginkgo enhanced cell proliferation and neuroblast differentiation (29). Flavonoids present in ginkgo extracts inhibited estrogen biosynthesis via aromatase inhibition, decreased CYP19 mRNA, and induced transcriptional suppression (30).Chemopreventive properties of bilobalide, a terpene trilactone, may occur via alterations in cryptal cell proliferation and drug-metabolizing enzyme activities (1). Exocarp polysaccharides from ginkgo affected expression of c-myc, bcl-2 and c-fos genes, which can inhibit proliferation and induce apoptosis and differentiation of human gastric tumor cells (3).",Leaf | Leaf,Fossil tree | Maidenhair tree | Kew tree | Bai guo ye | Yinhsing,Ginkgo | Ginkgo biloba leaf,Ginkgo Flavonglycosides | Ginkgo,Ginkgo,

In both TCM and Ayurveda, it is used in combination with isatis root and other herbs to treat the common cold, sore throat, mumps, respiratory ailments, other febrile diseases, hepatitis, and malignant tumors . Isatis root has both overlapping and different properties from isatis leaf. Isatis leaf is one of the ingredients used in PC-SPES, an herbal formula used to treat prostate cancer. It is also used in Danggui Longhui Wan, a formula used to treat chronic myelocytic leukemia in China . Preclinical studies indicate that isatis has antimicrobial, antiendotoxic , antiviral , immunostimulatory , anti-inflammatory , and chemotherapeutic properties. In several instances, the pharmacologic effects of isatis leaves were found to be greater than that of the roots . A preliminary study in healthy volunteers reported anti-inflammatory effects with use of topical isatis leaf. The pulverized form of isatis leaf, known as Qing Dai, has been used in small studies for the treatment of ulcerative colitis and showed benefit . However its use has also been associated with pulmonary arterial hypertension , so it should not be used outside of clinical trials. Additional studies are needed to determine safety and effectiveness. | Isatis root is derived from the isatis plant and is a source of indigo dye. In both traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) and Ayurveda, it is used in combination with isatis leaf and other herbs to treat the common cold, sore throat, mumps, respiratory ailments, other febrile diseases, hepatitis, and malignant tumors . Chinese clinical practice guidelines weakly recommend Banlangen granules to treat mild influenza , and the formula Danggui Longhui Wan is used in China to treat chronic myelocytic leukemia . Isatis root has also been promoted to ward off SARS. In vitro assays have identified specific compounds in isatis root with potential anti-SARS and anti-influenza activity , as well as cytotoxic activity against human liver cancer and leukemia cell lines . Several in vitro and animal studies also demonstrate antimicrobial , antiviral , anti-endotoxic , immunostimulatory , chemotherapeutic , and radioprotective effects . Animal models indicate anti-inflammatory, antipyretic, and antinociceptive effects . A small randomized study demonstrated utility of an isatis root extract solution to reduce severity of radiation mucositis, anorexia, and swallowing difficulty in head and neck cancer patients . Isatis leaf has both overlapping and different properties from isatis root.",,"In vitro, isatis leaf inhibits COX-2 with preferential effects on COX-2–catalysed prostaglandin synthesis (10). The alkaloid tryptanthrin has been identified as the inhibitor of COX-2 (10) and 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX) (13) (18). Indirubin, another active component, inhibits cyclin-dependent kinases and prevents proliferation by arresting cells in the G2/M phase (4). Other alkaloids isolated from isatis inhibit leukocyte function and attenuate production of mediators related to inflammatory responses (11). A compound derived from isatisine A showed moderate anti-HIV-1 activity (7), but better virucidal activity has been reported with the leaf, not root, extracts using a swine pseudorabies model (8).
Other animal models suggest that isatis leaf can reduce allergic airway inflammation and hyper-responsiveness by inhibiting production of Th2 cytokines IL-4 and IL-5, and RANTES (9). And when used as post-exposure prophylaxis, isatis leaf attenuated lung tissue damage and reduced lung virus titers (6). Findings also showed induction of hepatocellular cancer cell death by isatis via a caspase-independent apoptotic pathway (12).
In other mechanistic studies, Qing Dai prevented bisphosphonate-induced gastrointestinal injury by suppressing mitochondrial ROS production, the main cause of cellular lipid peroxidation (27). Qing Dai may cause PAH via NO synthase inhibition and endothelial dysfunction in the pulmonary artery (32). | Isatis root exerts immunostimulatory effects by enhancing reticuloendothelial system function (11). Sinigrin and indigo are compounds responsible for potential SARS inhibition (4). Clemastanin B, a major lignan compound, targets viral endocytosis, uncoating, and nuclear export of viral ribonucleoproteins (5). A crude extract of isatis root prevented influenza virus attachment to cells and therefore viral replication, but was inactive against respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus, parainfluenza virus, and enterovirus (19). Another component of isatis root demonstrates dose-dependent anti-endotoxic effects on lipopolysaccharide-induced expression of membrane-organizing extension spike protein, a main endotoxin receptor (10). Alkaloids isolated from isatis can inhibit leukocyte function and reduce inflammatory response (20). One animal study found that indigo root extract reduced tissue injury, enhanced hematopoietic system recovery, modulated serum inflammatory cytokines, and improved severe enteropathy in whole body irradiated mice (13).
In vitro, an ethanol extract of isatis root had a dose-dependent cytotoxic effect against HL-60 cells (9).

DSI003588,Rhubarb,C1119921,"Rhubarb, a perennial herb, is cultivated in many parts of the world and the stalks are sometimes consumed as food. The rhizome and root are used in Traditional Chinese Medicine to treat gastrointestinal and liver diseases . It is also used in herbal formulas such as Ma Zi Ren Wan. The anthraquinones and tannins in rhubarb are thought responsible for its laxative and constipating effects, respectively . In preclinical studies, rhubarb demonstrated anticancer , antimetastatic , radioprotective , and estrogen-receptor-modulating effects. The constituent aloe-emodin has demonstrated anticancer and anti-leishmanial properties, and appeared to enhance effects of sorefenib and cisplatin . Evidence for safety and efficacy in humans is limited. Preliminary data suggest rhubarb may have added benefits for patients with sepsis when used with the protease inhibitor ulinastatin , or may help treat recurrent aphthous stomatitis . Other studies suggest it may improve feeding tolerance and relieve gastrointestinal dysfunction in critically ill patients or help prevent procedure-related pancreatitis and hyperamylasemia in high-risk patients . A meta-analysis suggests that rhubarb adjuvant to early enteral nutrition may benefit patients with severe acute pancreatitis , but a systematic review does not support its use for gastrointestinal failure in ICU patients . In a small study of lung cancer patients, a rhubarb extract reduced radiation-induced lung toxicity and increased pulmonary function . A few studies have also been conducted using topical applications. Short-term treatment with a rhubarb navel plaster improved bowel function in patients with chronic constipation . A small study of an externally applied mirabilite rhubarb powder along with chemotherapy suggests symptom improvement in patients with malignant pleural effusion . Additional studies to confirm safety and efficacy are needed. Rhubarb is considered to be a stimulant laxative and is high in oxalates . Animal studies suggest the potential for liver toxicity at high doses and with long-term use . Rhubarb is also a component of Essiac tea. Patients and physicians should be aware of the potential for additive effects.",,"When used in small doses, the tannin content in rhubarb has a constipating effect. At higher doses, however, the hydrolyzed metabolites of emodin and sennidin stimulate the gastrointestinal tract and produce a laxative effect (4). The actions of anthraquinones on rheinanthrone, which is transformed from sennoside A, may promote the purgative effects of sennoside A (16).
The anti-inflammatory activity of emodin may mediate rhubarb’s hepatoprotective effects in rats with cholestatic hepatitis (11). Lindeyin, a phenolic gallylglucoside, exhibits analgesic and anti-inflammatory properties in animal models. Catechin, epicatechin, procyanidins, and gallylglucose were shown to inhibit hyaluronidase (10) (12).
Additional studies suggest that aloe-emodin exerts anti-proliferative activity, inducing cell cycle arrest in cancer cell lines (6). Anthraquinone extracts of rhubarb induced cytotoxicity in cancer cell lines (5) and tumor necrosis in mice (1), although this has not been demonstrated in humans. Another study showed that emodin inhibits human cancer cell invasiveness by specifically antagonizing the adenosine 5’-triphosphate-gated Ca(2+)-permeable channel P2X7 receptor (17).
Other animal studies suggest potential for liver toxicity at high doses and with long-term use, in part due to anthraquinone compounds such as rhein and emodin as well as tannins (40).",Root | Root,Turkish rhubarb | Chinese rhubarb | Tai huang | Da huang,Rhubarb | Rheum rhabarbarum,Himalayan Rhubarb | Indian Rhubarb (herb powder) | Indian Rhubarb | Rhubarb (unspecified) | Rhubarb,Rhubarb,

DSI003616,Olive,C1122969,"Derived from the olive plant, both olive leaves and the extract have been used to treat infections, inflammation, diabetes, and hypertension. A major component of olive leaf, oleuropein, has been shown to have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity . Because of its hypoglycemic effects, the leaf extract can induce insulin release and improve peripheral uptake of glucose . It also has antimicrobial , anti-HIV , and anticancer properties. Animal studies showed antiarrhythmic, spasmolytic, diuretic , antihypertensive , analgesic , and cholesterol-lowering effects. Small studies suggest olive leaf extracts may reduce metabolic risk factors , gastrointestinal discomfort and blood pressure . But data on its lipid-lowering effects are mixed . Topical use of an olive leaf extract cream was shown to be superior to acyclovir cream in healing herpes simplex virus infection .",,"The cholesterol-lowering effects of olive leaf extracts (OLE) are thought to be due to oleuropein, a compound present in the leaves. Studies on hypercholesterolemic rats suggest that OLE is more effective than pure oleuropein at lowering cholesterol. This implies that a synergistic effect occurs between oleuropein and another substance within the leaf (7).
Oleuropein is converted into elenoic acid in the body which may prevent viruses and bacteria from replicating (8). The antihypertensive and vasodilating effects of olive leaf occurred independently of the integrity of the vascular endothelium (9). Constituents of olive leaf have been shown to strongly inhibit the complement system, although it is unknown what effect this has on the body (10).
Hypoglycemic activities of olive leaf are attributed to two mechanisms: potentiation of glucose-induced insulin release and increased peripheral uptake of glucose. Hypoglycemic activity is greater in samples collected in the winter months (2). OLE may prevent diabetic neuropathy by reducing glucose-induced apoptosis through the inhibition of neural caspase 3 activation (20).
In vitro studies show that OLE has antimicrobial activities against E. coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, S. aureus, K. pneumoniae, Trichophyton mentagrophytes, Microsporum canis, T. rubrum, and Candida albicans (3) (22). Anti-HIV properties of OLE include upregulation of the expression of apoptosis inhibitor proteins as well as protein kinase signaling molecules (4). OLE promotes cell differentiation (18) and induces DNA fragmentation leading to apoptosis in leukemia cell line (19).",Flower,Olive leaf extract,Olive,Autumn Olive | Olive,Olive Leaf,

DSI003638,Peppermint,C2937963,"Peppermint is an herb prevalent in Europe and North America with a long medicinal history. It is taken orally as a carminative to treat digestive problems, applied topically as a counter-irritant for aches and cold symptoms, and its essential oil is used in aromatherapy. Peppermint is also widely used to flavor candies and oral hygiene products. Both its extracts and essential oil demonstrated antiviral, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant , antibacterial , antifungal , antidiabetic and antifibrotic effects in preclinical studies.Clinical data suggest benefits of topical peppermint oil for alleviating headaches and oral use for modulating cognitive performance , alleviating symptoms of dysphagia and chest pain , and controlling dyspepsia, gastric spasms, and general gastrointestinal discomfort . A combination of peppermint and caraway oils improved functional gastrointestinal disorders and was useful as a short-term treatment of dyspepsia . Pre-treatment with peppermint oil decreased pain and colonic spasms in patients during colonoscopy . Meta analyses suggest reductions in symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome although an ileocolonic-release oil did not have any benefit . Additional studies show peppermint may improve physical performance and hypothyroidism .Inhalation of peppermint oil relieved upset stomach, discomfort, and nervousness in pediatric surgical patients , controlled nausea and vomiting in pregnant women and postoperative cardiac surgery patients . But conflicting findings suggest aromatherapy to be only as effective as placebo for relief of postoperative nausea warranting more research .Peppermint also showed antitumor effects against several human cancer cell lines . Animal models indicate effectiveness against radiation-induced testicular damage , benzo[a]pyrene-induced lung carcinogenicity , and preventive effects against tobacco-induced carcinogenesis . An herbal mouthwash containing chamomile and peppermint alleviated complications and symptoms associated with oral mucositis in patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation . Inhalation of peppermint oil may reduce chemo-induced nausea and vomiting in pediatric and adult cancer patients .",,"Peppermint oil relieves gastrointestinal symptoms likely by regulating calcium channel-dependent processes within the gastric, intestinal, and colonic systems. Both peppermint oil and menthol, a major ingredient in peppermint, produce antispasmodic effects in these systems by diminishing calcium influx (6) (8) (18). Studies using murine models have shown that menthol improves body weight gain, mean macroscopic and microscopic ulcer scores, attenuates lipid peroxidation, oxidative stress and inflammation in acetic acid-induced colitis (49); essential oil of peppermint demonstrated antidiabetic effects in streptozotocin-nicotinamide-induced type 2 diabetes by upregulating the expression of Bcl-2 and insulin (47), along with attenuating hepatic fibrosis by improving the redox status, suppressing p53 and modulating TGF-beta1 and SMAD3 protein expression (48).Flavonoids in peppermint have antioxidant activity that may protect cells from radiation damage (12). Menthol has also been reported to induce PC-3 prostate cancer cell death by activating c-jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) (19).",Leaf/Leaves | Peppermint is used as flavoring agent in some foods and candy.,Balm mint | Japanese peppermint | Lamb mint | Our Lady's mint,Peppermint,Peppermint essence | Peppermint,Peppermint,

Small clinical studies have shown that it may lower cholesterol in patients with metabolic syndrome ; restore cognitive performance associated with mild age-related decline ; lower glycemic index in diabetic patients ; and improve quality of life in those with irritable bowel syndrome . In addition, consumption of red raspberries was associated with improvements in endothelial function ; and a pomegranate extract may have beneficial effects by inducing ellagitanin metabolite formation and changing microbiota .Pre-clinical studies indicate anticarcinogenic effects against liver, esophageal, prostate, and colorectal cancer cell lines . Ellagic acid was also shown to induce apoptosis and potentiate all-trans retinoic acid myeloid differentiation therapy in human leukemia HL-60 cells . In another study, pomegranate-derived ellagitannins exhibited anti-aromatase activity and suppressed testosterone-induced breast cancer cell proliferation, but ellagic acid did not have such effects .In an exploratory study of patients with biochemically recurrent prostate cancer, grape skin comprising ellagic acid, quercetin, and resveratrol was reported to be safe and to affect a non-significant increase in prostate-specific antigen doubling time . Further research is needed to assess the anticancer potential of ellagic acid.",,"Ellagic acid appears to inhibit chemical-induced esophageal carcinogenesis in animals (11). It down-regulates insulin-like growth factor IGF-II (6) and activates p53/p21 expression, leading to cell cycle arrest at the G1/S phase and apoptosis (12). In vitro studies report that ellagic acid protects cells from oxidative DNA damage caused by hydrogen peroxide and bleomycin (8). Ellagic acid’s ability to induce detoxification enzymes NADPH and quinone reductase contribute to some of its chemopreventive activities (13). Conversely, certain cytochrome P450 enzymes are inhibited by ellagic acid, preventing other carcinogens from being metabolized into more mutagenic forms (14) (15).","Punica granatum, Hull | Red raspberries, strawberries, pomegranates, walnuts","

DSI003894,Mistletoe,C0331018,"Mistletoe is a semi-parasitic plant that grows on various host trees. Mistletoe extracts are used for a variety of conditions including cancer, HIV, hepatitis, and degenerative joint disease. Oral preparations are available as dietary supplements and homeopathic remedies. However, most clinical research has evaluated mainly parenteral formulations, which are not approved for use in the United States by the Food and Drug Administration. Studies support the use of mistletoe to improve symptoms and quality of life, and reduce chemotherapy and radiotherapy side effects, including in pancreatic , lung , colorectal , and breast cancers. Some studies suggest it may help prolong survival , but other study results are mixed . Preliminary studies suggest that intravesical mistletoe extract is safe and well tolerated in patients with nonmuscle invasive bladder cancer , and that mistletoe extract injection may be efficacious for chemical pleurodesis in patients with malignant pleural effusion . In two studies with 5-year follow-ups of breast cancer patients, mistletoe did not appear to negatively influence chemotherapy efficacy and affected reductions in persistent symptoms . In patients with advanced solid tumors, the addition of mistletoe allowed for higher gemcitabine doses to be used without apparent pharmacokinetic interactions . Concomitant mistletoe appeared to reduce adverse events from monoclonal antibody therapy but not immune checkpoint inhibitors . Benefits with mistletoe treatment in combination with medical care have also been reported . Large prospective studies are needed to determine safety and whether these immune-related events translate to beneficial outcomes. Raw mistletoe contains toxic constituents. Possible adverse effects from mistletoe treatment include injection site reactions, chills, and fever . Long-term use may also reduce T-cell function in cancer patients , but the majority of reactions were mild to moderate and dose-related . Mistletoe inhibits CYP3A4 in vitro, so it could theoretically interact with drugs metabolized by this enzyme. However, this effect only happens in very high doses and is unlikely when used in clinically relevant concentrations .",,"In preclinical models, mistletoe has anti-inflammation (1) and anticancer effects (3) (4) (51). Mistletoe lectins are the most investigated single component of mistletoe extracts, with cytotoxic effects attributed in part to ribosome-inactivating properties and apoptotic induction (5). In vitro studies show that lectins induce macrophage cytotoxicity, stimulate immune-cell phagocytosis, increase TNFα, IL-1, IL-2, and IL-6 cytokine secretion, and enhance cytotoxicity (29). In lymphoblastic leukemia cells, mistletoe extracts stimulate dendritic cell maturation and activation (30) and induce dose-dependent apoptosis through caspase-8 and -9 dependent pathways (26).
In animal models, triterpene-containing mistletoe extracts produced the greatest apoptotic induction (26) and improved efficacy against malignant melanoma compared with conventional extracts via reduced tumor angiogenesis (31). Viscotoxins may also be responsible for tumor-inhibiting and immune-stimulating activities (28). However, mistletoe produced both pro- and anti-proliferative effects depending on dose (32).
Mistletoe preparations induce T-helper 2 immune response, as evidenced by significant eosinophilia during treatment in patients with chronic hepatitis C (2). Mistletoe-induced immune stimulation may explain physical improvements that contribute to increased quality of life in cancer patients (5).",Plant with berries,Viscum | All-heal | Birdlime | White-berry mistletoe,Mistletoe,Chinese Mistletoe | European Mistletoe | Mistletoe (unspecified),Mistletoe (European),

DSI003993,Passiflora,C0330470,"Passiflora incarnata is a perennial wildflower that is prevalent in the southern United States. Its extracts are used in supplemental forms to treat insomnia, anxiety, epilepsy, neuralgia, and withdrawal syndromes associated with opiates or benzodiazepines. It is also found in over-the-counter preparations to reduce symptoms associated with menopause and hyperactivity. Animal models suggest antidiabetic , antiasthmatic , and seizure suppression effects . Passionflower also reduced seizure severity, immobility, and retained brain levels of serotonin and noradrenaline . In another study, its extracts were shown to produce anxiogenic effects, although two of these extracts also showed an anticonvulsant effect against seizures . A pilot study of passionflower for generalized anxiety showed comparable efficacy to oxazepam and a systematic review determined it may improve symptoms associated with neuropsychiatric disorders . In patients undergoing surgery , and dental extractions , preoperative use of passionflower was reported to reduce anxiety. In healthy adults, consumption of a low-dose passionflower tea produced short-term benefits in sleep quality . Another study showed passionflower had comparable effects to a prescription drug for the treatment of ADHD . When used concurrently, passionflower was shown to enhance the pharmacologic effects of St. John’s wort .",,"The alkaloid constituents harman and harmaline are thought to produce monoamine oxidase inhibition (1), while maltol and gamma-pyrone derivatives cause activation of gamma amino butyric acid (GABA) receptors that may account for anxiolytic and sedative properties (11). Chrysin has also been identified among the bioactive metabolites with central nervous system (CNS) suppression activity (21).
In vitro, modulation of the GABA system by passionflower includes affinity to GABA(A) and GABA(B) receptors, and effects on GABA uptake (24). Antiradical activities observed are attributed to flavonoids such as isovitexin (25). An isolated benzoflavone moiety is suspected as being the strongest aromatase inhibitor in passionflower, although the flavone chrysin also has these properties (26).
In an animal reproductive and developmental study, passionflower produced sexual behavioral disruption in male adult rats that was not accompanied by alterations in plasma testosterone levels, reproductive-related organs, and glands weights or sperm count, and was potentially attributed to aromatase inhibition (27). In seizure models, protection against post-ictal depression not seen with diazepam controls point to activity from metabolites in passionflower rather than as a result of its seizure suppression effects (21).
Passionflower also exhibits mild anti-inflammatory activity. An ethanolic extract of passionflower reduced carrageenan-induced edema, leukocyte migration, and granuloma formation in mice, although the effect was less than that seen with aspirin (13).",Herb top | Fruit,Maypop | Apricot vine | Passion vine | Passiflore,Passiflora | Passiflora Edulis,Passiflora (unspecified) | Passionflower,Passionflower,

DSI004057,Bupleurum,C0873146,"Bupleurum is an important herb used in traditional Chinese and Japanese medicine. It is frequently prescribed in combination with other herbs to treat colds, fever, malaria, digestive disorders, chronic liver diseases, and depression. Herbal formulas such as Xiao Chai Hu Tang (Sho-saiko-to) and Xiao Yao San contain bupleurum as a major ingredient. Preclinical studies suggest that bupleurum has antiviral , hepatoprotective , anti-inflammatory , immune-modulating , antiproliferative , and chemopreventive properties. Experiments suggest bupleurum might exert some influence over multidrug resistance in drug-resistant cells . Saikosaponins, a major constituent, enhanced cisplatin cytotoxicity against solid tumors . In animal studies, bupleurum demonstrated inhibitory effects against allergic asthma . Experiments in both chronic mildly stressed and healthy rats describe differential effective and toxic responses . Saikosaponins were identified as the compound which may be responsible for bupleurum-induced liver injury . Studies of bupleurum in humans are lacking. Although a meta-analysis suggests Bupleurum chinense herbal formulas may help reduce depression severity, the evidence was considered to be of low quality . Poor quality control is also a concern with commercial herbal products. A sample of bupleurum was found contaminated with a nephrotoxic drug, aristolactone . In addition, the extent to which bupleurum is screened for levels of toxic compounds such as polyacetylenes in general is unclear .",,"Saikosaponins in bupleurum are the main constituent to which medicinal activities are attributed. In vitro studies indicate they exert anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting arachidonic acid metabolism (4). Bupleurum polysaccharides also have anti-inflammatory properties, attributed to their inhibitory effect on LPS-mediated Toll like receptor 4 (TLR4) signaling (17). Immunoregulatory activity of saikosaponin-d has been related to the promotion of interleukin-2 production and receptor expression as well as modulating T-lymphocyte function (3) (14). However, saikosaponins were also identified as the compound which may be responsible for dose-dependent bupleurum-induced liver injury (22).
Apoptotic effects of bupleurum may be partly mediated by increased c-myc and p53 mRNA levels along with decreased bcl-2 mRNA levels (6), and by inhibition of telomerase activity (9). In some solid tumor cells, bupleurum demonstrated antiadhesive and hemolytic effects (5) (8).",Root,Chai Hu | Hare's ear root | Thorowax root | Saiko,Bupleurum,Bupleurum | Bupleurum (unspecified),Bupleurum,

DSI004181,Licorice,C0017987,"Derived from the root of the plant, licorice is used to flavor foods. It is also used in traditional Chinese medicine to detoxify and enhance or balance the effects of other components in herbal formulations. In Ayurveda, licorice is used as a tonic, an expectorant, and as a demulcent. A number of compounds including glycyrrhizin are thought to be responsible for its biological effects. Licorice supplements are promoted for menopausal symptoms, digestive issues, cough, and bacterial and viral infections. Preclinical findings indicate antibacterial , antiviral , anticancer , anti-inflammatory , and hepatoprotective effects. Licorice also demonstrated estrogenic effects , reduced cardiotoxicity associated with doxorubicin , and improved the antitumor effects of cyclophosphamide .Clinical data suggest benefits in lowering dyspepsia and hyperlipidemia . Concurrent intake of a glycyrrhizin-containing product during alcohol consumption was found to have hepatoprotective effects . Licorice along with weight loss and lifestyle modification was found superior to lifestyle modification alone for the treatment of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease . When combined with fermented milk containing Lactobacillus paracasei, licorice reduced bacterial density and improved histologic inflammation in patients with H. pylori infection ; and preoperative gargling with a licorice solution reduced postoperative sore throat compared to gargling with sugar water . Licorice also accelerated healing in patients with second-degree burns . Systematic reviews have confirmed benefits of topical licorice in preventing postoperative sore throat .Licorice use also improved symptoms in patients with Parkinson’s disease suggestive of neuroprotective effects . When used as a mouthwash, it prevented dental caries ; improved xerostomia in hemodialysis patients ; and as a mucoadhesive film, was useful against oral mucositis during radiotherapy . A systematic review and meta analysis found herbal formulas containing licorice to alleviate chemo-induced gastrointestinal toxicity in patients with colorectal cancer .Of note, chronic ingestion of even moderate doses of licorice has been associated with hypertension and hypokalemia .",,"Glycyrrhizin, one of the bioactive compounds of licorice, can bind to glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid receptors, and exert its effects via inhibition of 11b-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (12). Licorice can reduce serum testosterone by inhibiting 17-hydroxysteriod dehydrogenase (35) (36). It also contains isoflavones and other constituents that have estrogen receptor-modulating activities (10). The flavone and liquiritigenin components selectively activate ER-beta (11).Animal studies suggest liquiritigenin may have neuroprotective effects via increasing expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor and phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase and cAMP response element binding in the hippocampus (55). Glycyrrhizic acid, a triterpene glycoside, demonstrated anti-allergic properties by restoring the immune balance of subsets 1 and 2 of T-helper cells in a dose-dependent manner. It also reduced B cells producing allergen-specific IgE and IgG1 (56).Licorice demonstrated chemopreventive effects by modulating expression of Bcl-2/Bax proteins, which act as apoptotic regulatory factors (3), and via inhibiting carcinogenesis (4). Other mechanisms include inducing apoptosis in human oral squamous cell carcinoma cells by regulation of the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway (60), and by modulating cyclin B1-CDK1 for G2/M arrest in prostate cancer cells (61).The most common side effect of licorice is hypokalemic hypertension, which occurs secondary to inhibition of 11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, a renal enzyme responsible for converting cortisol to cortisone. This inhibition results in enhancing the mineralocorticoid effects of cortisol (36) that include sodium retention and potassium excretion.",Stolons,Gan cao | Sweet root | Glycyrrhiza | Liquorice,Licorice,Licorice (unspecified) | Licorice | Licorice (various),Licorice,

Believed to have originated in China, kombucha has gained worldwide popularity as a functional food. The SCOBY consists of several acetic acid and lactic acid bacteria. Following fermentation, kombucha’s chemical makeup includes sugars, tea polyphenols, fiber, ethanol, amino acids and water-soluble vitamins . Health benefits attributed to kombucha include reduction of blood pressure and cholesterol along with anticancer and immunostimulatory effects. Preclinical studies have shown anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, immunostimulatory , hypolipidemic , and hepatoprotective effects with limited toxicity . In a small study involving 24 subjects with non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus, daily intake of kombucha was associated with normalized blood sugar values . Randomized studies have yet to be conducted . Kombucha is used as an immunostimulant, and to treat diabetes, cancer and AIDS . The high caffeine and sugar content of the tea may account for increase in energy levels following its consumption . However, kombucha can be easily contaminated during fermentation. Allergic reactions, jaundice, serious illness, and death have been associated following consumption of home-grown kombucha . It may also reduce the absorption of drugs that are sensitive to gastric pH level .",,"Kombucha demonstrated antimicrobial activity against a large number of pathogenic microorganisms at neutral pH and following denaturation, which suggests that it contains antimicrobial compounds other than acetic acid and large proteins (13).
Fermentation increases the potential for contamination with other microorganisms. Contamination with anthrax (10); and Aspergillus  (14), a fungus that is dangerous to people with lowered immune systems, have been reported.",Schizosaccharomyces pombe - whole,Champagne of Life | Manchurian mushroom | Tea Fungus | Kargasok Tea | Haipao | Combucha | Spumonto | Tschambucco,Kombucha,Kombucha,Kombucha,

It is widely used in teas for its relaxing and calming effects. In vitro and animal studies indicate that chamomile extracts have anti-inflammatory , anti-hyperglycemic , antigenotoxic , and anticancer properties. Apigenin, a flavone present in chamomile, has chemopreventive effects . Bisabololoxide A, another constituent, had additive inhibitory effects in some instances when used with 5-fluorouracil against leukemic cells . Clinical data suggest modest benefits with oral chamomile in chronic insomnia and for moderate cyclic mastalgia . Chamomile tea had positive effects on glycemic control in patients with diabetes . Several studies have reported that chamomile extracts are effective against mild-to-moderate and moderate-to-severe generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) . Chamomile may also reduce depressive symptoms in subjects with comorbid GAD plus depression and improve biological markers of stress in people with chronic anxiety . In other controlled trials, application of a chamomile compress was effective and superior to hydrocortisone ointment in facilitating healing of peristomal skin lesions following colostomy , and a chamomile oleogel affected pain relief in patients who had migraine without aura . Chamomile has also been evaluated in oral rinse and topical formulations for inflammatory conditions related to cancer treatment. Preliminary data on whether these products can reduce or prevent mucositis are mixed . Other preliminary findings suggest some benefit with a chamomile gel in preventing acute radiation dermatitis . Additional studies are needed.",,"The anti-inflammatory activity of chamomile involves release of LPS-induced prostaglandin E(2) via inhibition of COX-2 enzyme activity (11). Methanol extracts of chamomile exert antiallergic effects by inhibiting histamine release from mast cells (23). Neuroprotective activity has occurred via decreased lipid peroxidation and increased superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione, and total thiol levels (24).
Topical chamomile reduced tissue IL-1β and TNF-α in hamsters with oral mucositis (34). In another study, a chamomile extract provided gastroprotection against ethanol-induced ulceration by increasing glutathione levels (25). In an animal model of radiation‐induced intestinal mucositis, apoptotic effects occurred via increased cytosolic cytochrome c and caspase‐3, and depletion of mitochondrial B‐cell lymphoma‐2/Bax ratio (1).
Apigenin, a flavone component of chamomile, interacts with GABA(A)-benzodiazepine receptors in vitro and inhibits locomotor behavior in rats (5). It also affected alternative splicing of key mRNAs by inhibiting dimerization of hnRNPA2, a factor associated with many cellular malignancies and in mRNA metabolism and splicing (32).","Matricaria chamomilla, flower",German chamomile | Hungarian chamomile | Wild chamomile | Scented mayweed,Chamomile,Chamomile (not specified) | Chamomile | Chamomile (unspecified),Chamomile,

DSI004281,wheat germ,C0982459,"Fermented wheat germ extract (WGE) was developed in the 1990s by Hungarian chemist Mate Hidvegi. It should not be confused with wheat germ oil. WGE has been used as a dietary supplement by cancer patients in Hungary to improve quality of life.In vitro studies suggest WGE may have anticancer , antimetastatic , and immunomodulatory effects. Although it appears to increase estrogen receptor (ER) activity, WGE enhanced efficacy of tamoxifen, an ER antagonist, in ER+ breast cancer cells as well as cisplatin in ovarian cancer cell lines . Animal models suggest WGE may reduce cardiovascular symptoms due to chronic hypertension, diabetes, and obesity , mitigate lupus symptoms , and have antitumor effects comparable to endocrine treatments .Studies in humans are quite limited. A randomized trial of spermidine (extracted from wheat germ) failed to find improvements in memory in older adults with cognitive decline . Other studies suggest benefits of WGE in patients with colorectal cancer , to slow progression of castration-resistant prostate cancer and to reduce treatment-associated febrile neutropenia in pediatric cancer patients . When used along with chemotherapy, WGE may prolong survival of melanoma patients , but larger studies are needed to confirm these findings.Because it potentiates estrogen receptor activity, patients with hormone-sensitive cancers should use WGE with caution .",,"Benzoquinone compounds are thought to be active components of WGE (5). In vitro, WGE attenuates cell cycle progression from G2-M to G0-G1 phase, reduces ribonucleotide reductase activity (3) (4), and stimulates immune function via increased NK cell activity and intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) expression (16) (17). It also increases TNF and cytokine production by activating metabolic pathways involved in tumor cell death (14). In other experiments, WGE demonstrated cytotoxic effects on human lymphoma cells by inducing apoptosis (4) and against ovarian cancer cells via poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP)-1 and PARP-12 expression (5). It also regulated tumor cell proliferation by inhibiting glycolysis and pentose cycle enzymes (19), and induced apoptosis through caspase-3-mediated PARP cleavage (7).Compared to untreated cells, WGE-treated cancer cells had lower levels of VEGF, Cox-2 mRNA, and protein levels, markers of angiogenesis (21). WGE also contributed to impaired glucose utilization resulting in autophagy (22), and induced mobilization and homing of CD34(+) stem cells to the myocardial tissue, which may help stem cell-based regeneration of infarcted myocardium (23).",Triticum aestivum seed,Fermented wheat germ extract | MSC (Code Name),Defatted wheat germ protein,,Wheat germ extract,

Its dark red viscous latex, also known as Sangre de Grado or Dragon’s blood, has been used in traditional medicine for diarrhea and wound healing. In vitro and animal studies suggest it can promote the healing of gastric ulcers and inhibit cutaneous neurogenic inflammation . A mixture of proanthocyanidin oligomers isolated from the latex of C. lechleri has shown benefits for the treatment of travelers’ diarrhea and diarrhea experienced by AIDS patients . Named crofelemer, it has been approved by the FDA as a prescription drug to relieve diarrhea associated with antiretroviral therapy in AIDS patients . Supplementary analysis suggests it may also help reduce abdominal pain in women with irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea . A clinical trial is underway to determine feasibility and tolerability of crofelemer for preventing diarrhea in breast cancer patients receiving trastuzumab, pertuzumab, and docetaxel or paclitaxel (THP), or trastuzumab, pertuzumab, docetaxel, and carboplatin (TCHP) . In other studies, crofelemer was reported to be no more effective than placebo in AIDS patients with recurrent genital herpes , while topical use of a cream containing C. lechleri resin and pomegranate seed oil was found useful in preventing and improving skin changes associated with dermal scarring . C. lechleri demonstrated apoptotic effects in cancer cells . However, it also increased the viability of leukemic cells . Further research is needed to determine the anticancer potential.",,"SP-303, a mixture of proanthocyanidin oligomers, inhibited cAMP-mediated chloride secretion in two intestinal epithelial cell lines (6) (7). The dual inhibitory action of crofelemer, a purified proanthocyanidin oligomer, on two structurally unrelated prosecretory intestinal Cl(-) channels may account for the intestinal antisecretory activity (16). The sap of C. lechleri  also decreased capsaicin mediated chloride secretion (8) by inhibiting activation of sensory afferent nerves. In another study, it irreversibly altered the microtubule structure of cancer cells, preventing adhesion and inducing apoptosis (4). It also inhibited mutagenicity of 2-Aminoanthracene, although the mechanism is unknown (10). Topical application of Taspine, an alkaloid derived from C. lechleri sap, to a wound site produced an increase in wound healing activity (11) and an increase in the wound tensile strength 5-7 days following injury (12). Taspine promotes wound healing via increased migration of fibroblasts to the wound site (11) by acting as a chemotactic factor for fibroblasts (12).",Whole plant,Sangre de Drago | Dragon's Blood | Sangre de Grado | Sangre de Dragón | SP-303 | Crofelemer,Croton lechleri,,Croton lechleri,

Although Rhodiola rosea extract and its key constituent salidroside have been researched, data in humans are limited. In vitro studies suggest that salidroside may have neuroprotective and anticancer effects . Animal data suggest benefits with rhodiola on cognitive function, but most studies were determined to have a high risk of bias . In humans, preliminary data suggest rhodiola supplementation may improve physical endurance and mental performance , and reduce fatigue and stress . Other small studies suggest it may improve symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder and mild to moderate depression . In one study, it was better tolerated and had fewer side effects than sertraline, although it was also less effective . A systematic review evaluating rhodiola trials determined that higher reporting quality and better methodological quality are needed . In patients with breast cancer receiving epirubicin, a small study suggests that salidroside may have cardioprotective effects , but larger confirmatory studies are needed.",,"In vitro studies suggest that salidroside, a key constituent, confers neuroprotective effects via NO pathway inhibition (9), induces antioxidant enzymes thioredoxin, heme oxygenase-1, and peroxiredoxin-I; downregulates proapoptotic Bax protein; and upregulates antiapoptotic Bcl-XL proteins (8). Rhodiola constituents may also have synergistic antioxidant activity (17) and potential antidepressant effects may be due to inhibition of monoamine oxidases A and B (13). In human breast cancer cells, salidroside induced cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis via mechanisms as yet unidentified, but independent of the estrogen receptor (10).
In animal models, rhodiola exhibits dose- and time-dependent Th1 and Th2 cytokine modulation effects (16).",Root (standardized extract),Golden root | Rose root | Hong Jing Tian | Rose root extract | Rosenroot | SHR-5,Rhodiola,Rhodiola (unspecified) | Rhodiola,Rhodiola,

DSI004598,Schizandra,C1081320,"Schisandra has a long history of use in traditional Chinese medicine to treat coughs , liver conditions , stomach disorders , sweating , as an adaptogen , and as a tonic to improve vitality. It is also used in various formulas for fatigue and sleep. Its Chinese name, wu wei zi, means five-flavored fruit, to reflect the five flavors recognized in TCM: sour, bitter, sweet, pungent, and salty. In vitro studies suggest that schisandra has anti-inflammatory , anticancer , and cardioprotective effects . Animal studies also suggest cardio- and liver-protective effects . Schisandra appeared to enhance endurance and metabolism , improve cognitive functioning , and exhibit antimicrobial , antioxidant, neuroprotective , and anti-hyperglycemic activities in other preclinical models. Active lignans isolated from schisandra, particularly schisandrin A, appeared to reverse P-glycoprotein-mediated multidrug resistance of various cancer cell lines to doxorubicin, vincristine, and paclitaxel . Studies in humans are limited. Some suggest improvements in patients with fatty liver disease or hepatitis C when schisandra is used in combination with other substances . In liver transplant patients, schisandra appeared to reduce tacrolimus-associated side-effects of diarrhea and agitation and improve liver function . In a small study of renal transplant patients who were CYP3A5 expressers, a schisandra preparation reduced tacrolimus dosing requirements, improved initial dose accuracy, and resulted in fewer dose changes . In small studies of women, schisandra did not induce significant changes in obesity-related measures , but was helpful for menopausal symptoms . A study of a proprietary formulation that included schisandra suggests improved performance of cognitive tasks . In older adults doing regular low-intensity exercise, preliminary data suggest supplementation with a schisandra extract may enhance skeletal muscle strength, but it did not affect muscle mass . Additional research is necessary to determine actual efficacy attributable to schisandra and to uncover possible interactions or side effects associated with this supplement.",,"Lignans in schisandra have been linked to various effects including hepatoprotective (10), antiproliferative, and estrogenic activities (27). In vitro, schisantherins downregulated pro-inflammatory cytokines and mediators by blocking NF-κB and MAPK signaling (1). The anthocyanin Cya-3-O-xylrut has been identified as responsible for its antioxidant activity (18).
In animal toxicity models, pretreatment with schisandra lignans provided liver-protective effects via increased DT-diaphorase activity (10), and improved Phase I drug metabolism (28) (29). Schisandra also increased hepatic glutathione levels and glucose-6-phosphate and glutathione reductase activities (17). It lowered blood glucose levels via inhibition of α-glucosidase activity (19), and improved post-ischemic cardiac function by downregulating inflammatory cytokines, activating the eNOS pathway, inhibiting apoptosis, and enhancing cell proliferation (12). In amyloid-beta-induced memory impairment, schisandra increased superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase activities and glutathione levels in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus of mice while decreasing malondialdehyde and oxidized glutathione (14). It also enhanced endurance and metabolism in rat skeletal muscle by upregulating PGC-1α expression (13).
In human renal cell carcinoma cells, a schisandra polysaccharide identified as SCP induced apoptosis via caspase-3 and -9 activation, increased PARP cleavage, and inactivation of the ERK pathway (8). Another polysaccharide known as SCPP11 exhibited antitumor effects in hepatic cancer models via increased thymus index as well as serum IL-2 and TNF-alpha levels, and enhanced phagocytosis and NO production (26). Pgp-mediated chemotherapy drug-resistance in various cancer cell lines was reversed by schisandrins through the inhibition of Pgp and total protein kinase C function/expression (20).
Schisandra coadministration increased oral bioavailability of tacrolimus via inhibition of Pgp-mediated efflux and CYP3A-mediated metabolism, and reduction of intestinal first-pass effect (30).",Schisandra chinensis - fruit | Fruit,Wu wei zi | Schizandra | Five flavor berry | Gomishi | Omicha | Omija | Ngu mie gee,Schizandra | Schisandra,Schisandra,Schisandra,

DSI004616,Hawthorn,C1527346,"Derived from the flower, leaves, and fruits of the plant, hawthorn is also popularly referred to as Shan Zha in Asia. It is used in traditional Chinese medicine to improve digestion, stimulate appetite, treat cardiovascular conditions and hyperlipidemia, and invigorate blood . Hawthorn extract also has a long history in European medicine as a cardiotonic . In vivo and in vitro studies suggest a broad range of pharmacological properties including anti-inflammatory, gastroprotective, antimicrobial, and cardioprotective effects . Clinical studies have shown benefits in patients with congestive heart failure , and larger long-term studies of adjunctive hawthorn also suggest benefits . In addition, a systematic review concluded that adjunctive hawthorn improved physiological outcomes and symptom control in CHF patients . However two smaller trials did not find benefit , one of which suggested an increased early risk of disease progression . Studies that evaluate the hypotensive effects of hawthorn are mixed . Although data suggest a lack of notable interactions, definitive safety data are needed . Hawthorn also should not be used in place of conventional heart failure therapies and its use should be monitored by the treating physician .",,"Pharmacologic activities of hawthorn flower, leaf, and berry extracts are attributed to constituents such as flavonoids and oligomeric procyanidins (17) (22). Laboratory experiments suggest cardiac action of the flavonoids occurs via inhibition of the 3’,5’-cyclic adenosine monophosphate phosphodiesterase, and demonstrate positive inotropic effects by hawthorn that increase heart rate (4). Inotropic and vasodilatory effects have also been related to increased myocardial perfusion and reduced afterload (30). Antioxidant properties and inhibitory effects against LDL oxidation are attributed to phenolic compounds (31).",Crataegus monogyna- Fruit,May flower | Shan Zha | Crataegus berries | Quickthorn | Whitehorn,Hawthorn,Hawthorn,Hawthorn,

DSI004635,Green tea,C1384640,"Green tea is a beverage derived from the unfermented leaves of a plant native to Asia. Green tea extract is marketed as an antioxidant and dietary supplement to support cardiovascular, metabolic, cognitive, and cellular health. Active constituents include the polyphenol epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), caffeine, and theanine. Green tea consumption may reduce risk for dementia , hypertension , cardiovascular disease , and all-cause but not cancer-related mortality . Data are mixed on whether it can reduce risk of gastric and esophageal cancers . Other findings suggest preventive benefits with green tea and its active compounds against oral premalignant lesions and for those at high risk of developing liver or colorectal cancers but not colorectal adenomas . There is no association between green tea and risk for malignant lymphoma or multiple myeloma , but intake may reduce risk for myelodysplastic syndrome and kidney cancer . In prostate cancer patients, a blend of green tea, pomegranate, broccoli, and curcumin had a protective effect following post-radical treatment . Green tea consumption also decreased PSA levels in patients prior to prostatectomy . However, combination supplementation with the highest nontoxic doses of green tea catechins, selenium, and lycopene was associated with an elevated incidence of prostate cancer in high-risk patients , and long-term intake of an EGCG product did not reduce prostate cancer risk . Other limited data suggest oral EGCG may induce a biologic response in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia or reduce radiation-induced esophagitis in lung cancer patients , but did not prevent recurrence in advanced ovarian cancer . Topical EGCG may help relieve radiation-induced dermatitis in breast cancer patients , but these results are also preliminary. Regular green tea consumption may actually increase breast cancer risk in some postmenopausal women . Future studies are needed to resolve this ambiguity and to determine whether there are potential benefits on overall cancer risk . Additional studies suggest positive effects of green tea on blood pressure and glycemic control in type-2 diabetes patients , and on weight reduction in women with polycystic ovary syndrome . Moderate green tea consumption was not associated with increased risk of kidney stone formation , but the caffeinated form may cause insomnia and nausea. Animal models suggest use of green tea extract during fasting may increase toxicity risk . Clinical data show that EGCG 200 mg twice daily for one year is safe , whereas 800 mg daily was associated with elevated liver enzymes .",,"Green tea may confer cardiovascular protection by increasing HDL and lowering LDL and triglyceride levels (28). Blood pressure modulation may be mediated by EGCG which induces NO production that results in vasodilation (29). Neurocognitive benefits with green tea extract may occur from enhanced brain connectivity during working memory processing (30), and EGCG may inhibit tau protein aggregation to reduce toxicity in neuronal model cells (31).
Chemopreventive properties are attributed to polyphenols, particularly EGCG which may inhibit enzymes involved in cell replication and DNA synthesis (32). In vitro data suggest concentrations of 30 mcg/mL of EGCG and EGC inhibit arachidonic acid metabolism by 30–75%, which may reduce colon cancer risk (33). Other studies in human colon cancer cell lines suggest EGCG inhibits topoisomerase I but not II (34). It also inhibited DNA replication in leukemia cancer cell lines (35), and modulated VEGF leading to apoptosis in leukemic cells (36). An early animal study identified caffeine in green tea as an important component for inhibition of UVB light-induced carcinogenesis (37).",Leaf,Chinese tea | Green tea extract | Green tea polyphenols | Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG),Green tea,Green Tea,Green Tea,

Grape seed extract is marketed as a supplement for its antioxidant properties. Preclinical studies of grape seed proanthocyanidin extract (GSPE) suggest cardioprotective and anticancer effects . Other studies suggest synergistic effects with doxorubicin or that it can help minimize various drug-induced toxicities . Topical application accelerated wound contraction and closure . Preliminary studies in humans suggest grape seed extract can reduce LDL , increase total serum antioxidant activity , and benefit patients undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery . Meta-analyses suggest GSE may lower systolic blood pressure and heart rate, but are mixed on whether it improves lipid, glucose, and inflammatory markers . Other data suggest it may provide adjunctive benefit in patients with diabetic retinopathy . Supplementation with grape seed may be associated with decreased risk of hematologic malignancies . In prostate cancer patients, a pulverized muscadine grape skin from Vitis rotundifolia was safe and tolerable , but clinical benefit needs to be assessed. Oral GSPE did not improve radiotherapy adverse effects of tissue hardness, pain, or tenderness in breast cancer patients .

People generally consume 460-1000 mg/day of these combined substances (9). GPSE has protective effects on doxorubin-induced cardiotoxicity (3). Cardioprotective effects may be due to its ability to modulate anti-apoptotic genes and modify molecular targets such as DNA damage and repair, lipid peroxidation, and intracellular calcium homeostasis (5).","Seed(s) | Red wine grapes; compounds in grape seed extract are also found naturally in many other foods including fruits, vegetables, chocolate, and tea.",Grape Seed Oil | Grape Seed Extract | Muskat,Grape Seed,Caribbean Grape | Grape | Oregon Grape,Grape Seed,

DSI004652,Maca,C0872905,"Maca is a nutritionally valuable plant native to Peru that grows in harsh climates above 4,000 feet. It has been used traditionally to enhance fertility and sexual performance in both men and women and to relieve menopausal symptoms . In vitro, maca or its constituents have demonstrated antiviral , antioxidant , anti-inflammatory, analgesic, or neuroprotective activities. Animal studies suggest maca may increase endurance , enhance sexual function , and improve memory deficits . It also demonstrated antidepressant and postmenopausal hormone-modulating effects. Only a few small trials have been conducted in humans. Maca consumption was associated with lower serum IL-6 levels and higher health status . In men, preliminary findings suggest supplementation may enhance subjective sexual well-being , but data are mixed on whether it can affect various parameters of semen quality or sperm concentration . A systematic review determined high dose supplementation to improve antidepressant-induced sexual dysfunction . In women, several studies suggest maca improves both antidepressant- and menopause-induced sexual dysfunction although one small study showed neither hormonal nor immunological effects . In addition, systematic reviews have deemed evidence for improving sexual dysfunction or menopausal symptoms to be limited. Another review found maca is not an effective anti-aging agent . A case report showed maca may interfere with testosterone immunoassays . Although it is unclear the extent to which maca may affect blood hormone levels, patients should discuss any use of this supplement with their physician.",,"Maca contains glucosinolates, mostly benzylglucosinolate, along with hydroxy or methoxylated benzyl derivatives and tryptophan-derived compounds, and depending on the phenotype (red, yellow, purple or black) may be associated with different biological effects (31).
In vitro, both methanolic and aqueous extracts of maca exhibit estrogenic activity (10). A methanol maca extract demonstrated antiviral activity against Flu-A and Flu-B viruses (17). An isolated N‑alkylamide from maca root exerted cannabimimetic actions (32). Maca polysaccharides demonstrated radical scavenging activity (18). Macamides, normally not present in fresh plants but introduced during traditional drying practices (31), are fatty acid amide hydrolase inhibitors that modulate release of neurotransmitters (19). Antidepressant-like effects were associated with activation of both noradrenergic and dopaminergic systems and attenuation of oxidative stress (20).
In animal models, maca powder enhanced serum luteinizing hormone (LH) levels in female rats during the proestrus LH surge in a dose-dependent manner, suggesting it may enhance fertility (33). In postmenopausal models, maca modulates hormone levels particularly by decreasing follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels (21).
In humans, although maca does not affect serum levels of LH, FSH, prolactin, testosterone, or estradiol in men (4) (9), it appears to modulate some hormone levels in women in some studies (24) (26) but not others (25) (27). Increased LH and decreased FSH that corresponded with improved sexual functioning in postmenopausal women are potentially attributed to a negative feedback loop, resulting in increased androgen production (24) (26). It may also exert androgenic effects at the testosterone receptor on target organs without affecting testosterone or gonadotrophin levels (24) (30). At the same time, the benefits of maca for antidepressant-induced sexual dysfunction in women may be more a function of advancing age rather than menopausal status, as there was no correlation with estrogen levels (24).",Lepidium meyenii - Root,Maca-maca | Maino | Ayak chichira | Ayak willku,Maca,Maca,Maca,

DSI004693,Ashwagandha,C0613707,"A popular Ayurvedic herb, ashwagandha is often used in formulations prescribed for stress, strain, fatigue, pain, skin diseases, diabetes, gastrointestinal disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and epilepsy . It is also used as a general tonic to improve energy levels, health, and longevity , and topically as an analgesic . Active constituents include alkaloids, steroidal lactones, saponins, and withanolides. Ashwagandha has neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory properties which may protect against cartilage damage in osteoarthritis . It also improved hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, and insulin sensitivity in a murine model of type 2 diabetes . Other studies indicate cytotoxic, immunomodulating , chemopreventive and radiosensitizing effects , and enhancement in chromosomal stability . Small studies suggest ashwagandha may promote growth, hemoglobin level, and red blood cell count in children , improve sexual health , male infertility , and relieve mild to moderate climacteric symptoms in perimenopausal women . Findings also indicate that it relieves anxiety and stress , with a systematic review/dose-response meta-analysis citing the need for high-quality evidence . Additional studies showed improvements in both non-restorative sleep in healthy adults and sleep quality in patients with insomnia . In patients with schizophrenia, adjunctive use improved symptoms and stress , and affected markers of metabolic syndrome . Preliminary data suggest improvements in measures of cognitive function in patients with bipolar disorder and balance in patients with progressive degenerative cerebral ataxias . Ashwagandha formulations were also shown to benefit patients with osteoarthritis and produced analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and chondro-protective effects in those with knee joint pain . Ashwagandha also showed anticancer effects against several cancer cell lines , but was ineffective against drug-resistant cancer stem cells . It prevented chemotherapy-induced neutropenia in a murine model , and the compound Withaferin A enhanced oxaliplatin effects in human pancreatic cancer cells . In a small trial of breast cancer patients, ashwagandha alleviated chemotherapy-induced fatigue and improved quality of life . Confirmatory research is needed. Ashwagandha may increase testosterone levels and therefore, patients with hormone-sensitive prostate cancer should consult their physicians before taking it .",,"Alkaloids, steroidal lactones, saponins, and withanolides are considered the biologically active components of ashwagandha. Anti-arthritic effects are attributed to cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibition.
In animal studies, anti-inflammatory activity by ashwagandha was comparable to hydrocortisone (15). Brain antioxidant effects and CNS tranquilizing effects may be due to influences on GABA receptor function (2) (17). Withanolides in the roots and leaves are considered similar to steroids in their biological activities (41). Triethylene glycol, a compound isolated from the leaves, was identified as an active sleep-inducing component in a murine model, and may potentially be used to relieve insomnia (42).
Microarray analysis revealed that ashwagandha represses proinflammatory gene expression, including IL-6, IL-1β, IL-8, Hsp70, and STAT-2, and induces p38/MAPK expression in a prostate cancer cell line (16). Ashwagandha may inhibit tumor growth (1) (21) and increased cytotoxic T lymphocyte production (8). In vitro studies show that root extracts have cytotoxic properties against lung, colon, CNS, and breast cancer cell lines (6). Withaferin A induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and disruption of mitochondrial function in a human leukemia cell line, thereby inducing apoptosis (18). In estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) and negative (ER-) breast cancer cells, withaferin A induced apoptosis and decreased tumor size (19). Apoptosis of cancer cells by withanone is mediated through p53 (7). Withianone also exerts anticancer activity by binding to the TPX2-Aurora A Complex (29). Other studies show ashwagandha cytotoxicity is related to its structure. It enhances ATPase and inhibits succinate dehydrogenase activities, impairing oxidative phosphorylation.
In animal studies, ashwagandha enhanced radiation therapy effects (20) by reducing tumor GSH levels (10), and reversed paclitaxel-induced neutropenia in mice (12). No significant interactions have been reported between ashwagandha and either CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 enzymes in human liver microsomes (40).",,Ashwagandha | Indian ginseng | Winter cherry,,Ashwagandha,Ashwagandha,

DSI004695,mushroom,C0678206,"Oyster mushroom is an edible fungus found widely in North America and Europe. It is used in traditional medicine to treat infections, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, and cancer. Preclinical studies suggest antitumor , immunomodulatory , antifungal , lipid-lowering, and hypoglycemic properties. Beneficial effects are due to constituents such as polysaccharides, lectins, and peptides. Studies in humans are limited. Oyster mushroom improved postprandial metabolism in patients with impaired glucose tolerance and exhibited hypoglycemic activity in diabetic patients . However, it did not lower non-HDL cholesterol in a study of HIV patients with antiretroviral treatment-induced hypercholesterolemia . Other small studies suggest that pleuran, a beta-glucan isolated from oyster mushroom, may have anti-allergic effects in children with respiratory tract infections .",,"Pleurostrin, a peptide derived from the fruiting bodies of oyster mushroom, exhibit antifungal properties (2). The compound mevinolin decreased cholesterol biosynthesis by inhibiting HMG CoA reductase, the rate-limiting enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis (3). Suggested hypoglycemic mechanisms include increased glucokinase activity and insulin secretion, which increases glucose utilization by peripheral tissues, inhibits glycogen synthase kinase, and promotes glycogen synthesis (19).
A lectin isolated from the fruiting bodies of oyster mushroom demonstrated antitumor activity in mice bearing sarcoma and hepatoma (1). Another study found development of precancerous aberrant crypt foci significantly reduced in mice fed a diet containing 10% pleuran, an isolated beta-glucan (4). RNase Po1, a guanylic acid-specific ribonuclease from oyster mushroom induced apoptosis in tumor cells (18).
The compound ostreolysin caused bradycardia, myocardial ischemia, and ventricular extrasystoles following intravenous injection in mice (14).","Oyster mushroom is an edible fungus, available both in fresh and dried forms.

DSI004703,Mushroom,C2741534,"Chaga mushroom is commonly found on birch trees in cold climates. It is used as a folk remedy in Russia and other northern European countries to treat various ailments and diseases including cancer. The conk that is used medicinally comprises wood from the substrate tree and mycelium of the invasive fungus . In preclinical studies, chaga showed antitumor , anti-mutagenic , antiviral , antiplatelet , antidiabetic , antioxidant , analgesic , immunomodulating , anti-inflammatory and pain-relieving , anti-allergic , cognition-enhancing, and antioxidant effects . Oral administration of polysaccharides from chaga increased exercise endurance and biological measures related to fatigue and may also have antidiabetic effects . In addition, chaga extracts and its constituents showed inhibitory and pro-apoptotic effects against colon , lung and liver cancer cells, and the active constituent Inotodiol exhibited antitumor activity against cervical cancer cells . Chaga has also been shown to induce selective apoptosis in tumor cells without impacting healthy cells , and inhibited melanoma in a murine model . But the safety and efficacy of chaga have yet to be evaluated in clinical studies. Because natural reserves of this fungus have nearly been exhausted, scientists are seeking to develop cultivated substitutes of wild chaga . | Reishi mushroom is a fungus that holds an important place in the traditional medical systems of China, Japan, Korea and other Asian countries for its health-promoting effects. It is used as an immunostimulant by patients with AIDS and cancer. The active constituents include both beta-glucan polysaccharides and triterpenes . Extracts of reishi were shown to have immunomodulatory , renoprotective , anti-inflammatory , and hepatoprotective properties both in vitro and in vivo. Clinical studies indicate its benefits in improving lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) in men , and in exerting mild antidiabetic effects and improving dyslipidemia . However, randomized controlled trials do not support the use of reishi for reducing cardiovascular risk factors associated with type 2 diabetes , and reishi did not influence blood or anthropometric measurements in patients with fibromyalgia . A pilot study of reishi spore powder did not find it helpful in treating patients with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) . Preclinical findings indicate that reishi has immunomodulatory and chemopreventive effects , alleviates chemotherapy-induced nausea , enhances the efficacy of radiotherapy , and increases sensitivity of ovarian cancer cells to cisplatin . It may also help prevent cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity . In small clinical studies, reishi increased plasma antioxidant capacity , enhanced both immune and tumor response in cancer patients , and suppressed development of colorectal adenomas . Remission of hepatocellular carcinoma has also been reported in a few cases in a single study , and a formula containing reishi and ligustrum helped maintain the quality of life in non-small cell lung cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy . But a reishi extract was found to have toxic effects in leukocytes . Also, patients undergoing treatment for gastrointestinal cancer had higher levels of the serum tumor marker CA72-4 after taking reishi spore supplements . Further research is needed to determine the safety and effectiveness of reishi as an adjunctive cancer treatment.",,"Oxalic, gallic, protocatechuic and p-hydroxybenzoic acids have been identified in chaga extracts (12). In vitro, antidiabetic effects are attributed to terpenoids that inhibit alpha-glucosidase (15). Anti-inflammatory and pain-relieving properties may occur via inhibition of nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) (3). Immunomodulating effects are attributed to Th1/Th2 cytokine secretion in immune cells and regulation of antigen-specific antibody production (16). Anti-quorum sensing activity in chaga conks suggests broader anti-infection attributes beyond immunomodulatory effects (12).
In animal studies, a methanolic extract of chaga produced beneficial effects on learning and memory via decreased malondialdehyde and nitrite levels, decreased acetylcholinesterase activity, and restored glutathione, superoxide dismutase, and acetylcholine levels (18). Antifatigue effects were attributed to polysaccharides from chaga, which increased endurance and glycogen content of liver and muscle in mice, while decreasing blood lactic acid and serum urea nitrogen levels (20). Anti-inflammatory effects in animal colitis models were related to suppression of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, iNOS, and interleukin (IL)-1beta (19).
3beta-hydroxy-lanosta-8, 24-dien-21-al, and inotodiol constituents in chaga produce antimutagenic and antioxidative activities (9). Water-soluble lignin derivatives have also been identified as bioactive constituents with anticancer properties (26). A hot-water extract of chaga exhibited inhibitory and proapoptotic actions against colon cancer cells via upregulation of Bax and caspase-3 and downregulation of Bcl-2 (5). Inhibition of colorectal cancer was exerted by the constituent ergosterol via downregulation of the beta-catenin pathway (21). Inotodiol, a triterpenoid isolated from chaga, inhibited proliferation of cervical cancer cells and induced apoptosis in vitro via increased Bax expression, decreased Bcl-2, cyclin E downregulation, and p27 up-regulation (23). Aqueous extracts of chaga inhibited growth of human hepatoma cells via G0/G1 phase cell-cycle arrest and selective apoptotic induction (1). Other apoptotic characteristics can induce caspase cleavage and nuclear fragmentation (7). | Beta glucans, polysaccharides present in reishi, demonstrated antitumor and immunostimulating activities (18) (40). Its triterpene compounds may inhibit tumor invasion by reducing matrix metalloproteinase expression (16), and tumor metastases by limiting attachment to endothelial cells (17). Findings also indicate that reishi induces natural killer (NK) cell cytotoxicity against various cancer cell lines via activation of the natural cytotoxic receptors (NKG2D/NCR) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-signaling pathways, which result in exocytosis of perforin and granulysin (31). Reishi polysaccharides were shown to increase expression of the major histocompatibility (MHC) class I and costimulatory molecules on melanoma cells, resulting in enhanced antitumor cytotoxicity (32). In ovarian cancer cells, reishi induced G2/M phase cell cycle arrest, activated caspase 3 to induce apotosis, increased p53, and inhibited Akt expression (27).","Although chaga is an edible fungus, it is not commonly ingested due to its bitter nature.

DSI004744,Amygdalin,C0002707,"Amygdalin is a naturally occurring cyanogenic glycoside derived from nuts, plants, and the pits of certain fruits, primarily apricots. Bitter almonds containing amygdalin are used in Traditional Chinese Medicine to remove “blood stasis” and to treat abscesses . Amygdalin was first used to treat cancer more than a century ago in Russia and later in the United States. A purified form sold as Laetrile has been a popular alternative cancer therapy since the 1960s. Some claimed amygdalin to be a vitamin (B17) and that deficiencies could cause cancer, but this is not substantiated by scientific evidence . Amygdalin is banned in the United States, but it is available in other countries and online. Amygdalin is metabolized by the enzyme beta-glucosidase into benzaldehyde, glucose and cyanide in the intestine . Cyanide is believed to be cytotoxic with actions selective against cancerous cells, but results from animal studies were mostly negative . Other preclinical data suggest that amygdalin has hepatoprotective effects ; may help relieve pain due to anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties ; and exerts protective effects in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease . Amygdalin also inhibited tumor growth, but further studies are needed to confirm this finding . A clinical trial in the late 1970s supported by the National Cancer Institute did not find amygdalin beneficial, and some patients in the study developed cyanide toxicity . A systematic review also concluded that amygdalin is ineffective against cancer . With the recent discovery of anticancer properties of amygdalin through previously unknown mechanisms , there is renewed interest in whether this agent may have potential as an anticancer treatment. However, amygdalin is not approved for use in the United States.",,"Amygdalin is metabolized by the enzyme beta-glucosidase, which removes the glucose molecules to form prunasin and mandelonitrile. This is further broken down to benzaldehyde and hydrocyanic acid (3) (4). When consumed orally, amygdalin is more likely to produce cyanide toxicity, compared with the injectable form (17), possibly due to the presence of enzymes from the microflora in the intestine (18). Cyanide from the hydrolysis of amygdalin is cytotoxic. It was postulated that this action is selective against cancerous cells because normal cells convert the cyanide to benign thiocyanate via rhodanese (19) (20) (21). This theory has not been proven in humans (22).
Amygdalin demonstrated anti-inflammatory effects by promoting immunomodulation of Treg cells (24). In animal studies, amygdalin suppressed prostaglandin E(2) synthesis and NO production through COX-2 and iNOS inhibition (7). It also reduced inflammation pain by inhibiting TNF-alpha and IL-1beta (8), and exerts neurotrophic effects by activating the extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 pathway (25).
Recent studies found amygdalin may have anticancer effects. In animal models, amygdalin inhibits the tumor-promoting effect of the Epstein-Barr virus (12). In human prostate cancer cells, it increased pro-apoptotic Bax protein expression and caspase-3 enzyme activity, while decreasing anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein expression (23). It also downregulates cell cycle-related genes in human colon cancer cells (13). Amygdalin may inhibit growth and proliferation in bladder cancer cell lines by decreasing cell cycle regulatory proteins cdk2 and cyclin A (16). It also induces growth-regulating protein follistatin expression in human hepatocarcinoma cells (15).",,Apricot pits | Vitamin B17 | Mandelonitrile-beta-glucuronide (semi-synthetic) | Mandelonitrile beta-D-gentiobioside (natural product) | Laevorotatory and mandelonitrile | Prunasin,,Amygdalin,Amygdalin,

DSI004792,Pawpaw,C0330214,"Asimina triloba, commonly known as pawpaw, is native to North America and has edible bean-shaped fruits. In vitro studies show that pawpaw extract has cytotoxic effects against cancer cell lines including those resistant to adriamycin , as well as antiangiogenic activity . Compounds known as acetogenins are thought to be the active constituents . Clinical studies have not been conducted. Extracts of pawpaw twigs and leaves have been used in anti-lice shampoos and as pesticides . Both the crude fruit extract and annonacin, a major constituent of pawpaw, cause neurotoxicity in vitro . Asimina triloba should not be confused with graviola, also known as Brazilian pawpaw, or with papaya, another fruit with a similar texture and appearance.",,"Acetogenins, the active constituents of pawpaw fruit, inhibit Complex I of the electron transport chain and NADH oxidase, a protein in the plasma membrane (1). With the decrease in regenerable NAD, the ATP levels drop, leading to subsequent cell death by apoptosis.
In vivo experiments have demonstrated pawpaw’s cytotoxicity in mice (5). Pawpaw extract is also cytotoxic to multidrug-resistant cells in vitro, perhaps via inhibition of the P-170 glycoprotein, an efflux pump used by cells resistant to drugs like adriamycin (1).
Annonacin, a major ingredient of pawpaw fruit, and the crude fruit extract are toxic to cortical neurons (10).",Pawpaw fruit,False banana | Pawpaw apple | Custard banana | Poor man's banana | Hoosier banana,,American Pawpaw,American pawpaw,

DSI004810,AHCC,,"Active hexose correlated compound (AHCC) is a proprietary extract derived from the mycelia of shiitake (Lentinus edodes) mushrooms. It is rich in alpha-1,4-glucan oligosaccharides that are thought to enhance its biological effects . Patients use AHCC to prevent and treat cancer. AHCC showed anti-inflammatory and anticancer effects , enhanced resistance to microbial infections , and may protect against oxidative stress-induced disorders . In healthy adults, AHCC improved T-cell immune responses , increased dendritic cell number and function , improved antibody response to influenza vaccine , and when used with Bifidobacterium longum, modulated T regulatory and dendritic cell phenotypes to favor anti-inflammatory responses after antibiotic use . Preliminary findings suggest that AHCC may improve prognosis and prevent recurrence after curative resection of hepatocellular carcinoma , improve nutritional status when given during neoadjuvant therapy , and reduce chemo-associated adverse effects . However, in an open-label multicenter study of patients with early stage prostate cancer, AHCC was ineffective in reducing prostate-specific antigen levels by 50% or more . Further research is needed to determine the therapeutic potential of this extract.",,"AHCC glucans are low molecular weight (~5 KDa) polysaccharides with alpha-1,3 linkages. Both properties are unusual for this class of compounds with reported immunomodulatory properties (7). Proposed mechanisms include orchestrating immune responses and maintaining immune homeostasis in part by priming TLR-2 and TLR-4 (toll-like receptor) gates at the intestinal epithelium (24).
AHCC enhanced natural killer cell activity to induce endogenous IL-12 in mice (8), improved murine response to influenza infection (15), increased resistance to West Nile virus by improving T-cell response (16), and increased resistance to bacterial infection (3) likely via increasing inflammatory cytokine and chemokine expression as well as lymphocytes (13).
In healthy adults, AHCC enhanced CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell immune responses (19). In patients with hepatocellular carcinoma and cirrhosis, beneficial effects on liver function (10) are thought to  be via regulation of nitric oxide production (14).
AHCC also enhanced antitumor effects of 5-fluorouracil by enhancing apoptosis, upregulating expression of BCl-2 associated X protein, and by downregulating B cell lymphoma 2 (26). Proposed mechanisms for overcoming drug resistance in cancer cells include downregulation of Heat Shock Factor 1, which induces heat shock protein HSP27, known to be involved in gemcitabine resistance (27).",,Active Hexose Correlated Compound,,AHCC,AHCC,

DSI005058,Vitamin,C0042890,"As a dietary supplement advertised on the Internet and elsewhere, Vitamin O is promoted to prevent and treat cancer, HIV/AIDS, cardiovascular disease, pulmonary disease, and other chronic illnesses by detoxifying the body and improving metabolism via high doses of molecular oxygen. It is purported to contain 30,000 ppm stabilized oxygen molecules in a solution of sodium chloride and distilled water. The anticancer activity of vitamin O is based on the theory that cancer cells grow in an oxygen-poor environment and cannot proliferate in oxygen-rich conditions. Vitamin O was advertised in national newspapers for mail-order purchase until the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) filed a complaint against its marketers, Rose Creek Health Products, Inc., and Staff of Life, Inc., in March 1999. The FTC found, contrary to the advertisement claims, that Vitamin O does not allow oxygen molecules to be absorbed through the gastrointestinal system, does not prevent or treat any physical ailment or disease, does not have a beneficial effect on human health, has not been proven effective by medical or scientific research, and was not developed by NASA for use of astronauts .",,"Supposed efficacy is based on the idea that most degenerative diseases result from decreased levels of atmospheric oxygen caused by industry and deforestation. Stress, toxins, and modern diets of processed foods, fats, sugar, alcohol, white flour, and caffeine are said to make the body oxygen-deficient because more oxygen is required to metabolize them (1).
Vitamin O marketers misappropriate the discovery of higher atmospheric oxygen levels in past geologic eras to conclude that the human body evolved to function at higher concentrations of oxygen than is now available; the dissolved oxygen content of most people’s bodies is considerably lower than that needed to maintain sufficient metabolism; and that the lower the level of dissolved oxygen in a person’s body, the greater the susceptibility to disease.
While supplemental respiratory oxygen is thought to have anticancer activities by enhancing T cells and NK cells (3), none of the claims on oral vitamin O supplement are supported by laboratory or clinical evidence.",,Stabilized oxygen,,Blend (Vitamin) | Proprietary Blend (Vitamin) | Vitamin (unspecified),Vitamin O,

DSI005068,Green Algae,C0002032,"Blue-green algae, also known as Cyanobacteria, are primitive autotrophic prokaryotes. They are a source of food in some parts of the world and patients take the supplemental forms to prevent and treat cancer, viral infections, and for weight loss. Spirulina species are cultured in alkaline fresh water whereas Aphanizomenon flos aquae (AFA) is naturally grown and harvested from Upper Klamath Lake, Oregon, USA. Blue-green algae products frequently contain one or both of these strains of algae. Small studies have shown that spirulina may be effective against allergic rhinitis ; for managing diabetes ; for lowering cholesterol in patients with nephrotic syndrome-induced hyperlipidemia ; for relief from chronic pain ; may benefit obese and overweight adults by reducing obesity indices ; benefit those with mild cognitive impairment ; and improve quality of life in ulcerative colitis patients . Spirulina may also be effective against chronic hepatitis C virus infection and adjunctive use, against oral lichen planus . Foods fortified with spirulina were found to help motor development and prevent morbidity due to upper respiratory infections in infants and positively affect development in children . Supplementation may benefit HIV patients via immunomodulatory effects and by reducing viral load . Animal models suggest that spirulina has chemo- and radioprotective effects , but human studies are lacking. It is important to note that blue-green algae may be contaminated by strains of algae (e.g. Microcystis species) that are toxic.",,"Calcium spirulan, a polysaccharide extract from Spirulina platensis, demonstrates inhibition of HIV-1 viral replication via possible binding and disruption of CD4-gp120 interaction in vitro, although the clinical significance of this is unknown (15). Calcium spirulan also inhibits replication of herpes simplex I, cytomegalovirus, and influenza. Other studies showed that spirulina has chemoprotective and radioprotective effects in animals (6), affected by stimulation of the hemopoietic system.
Although uncommon, several toxins from Microcystis species of algae may contaminate AFA-algae and Spirulina algal blooms. Anatoxin can cause paralysis of respiratory muscles due to irreversible binding and sustained action of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor. Saxitoxin contamination is thought to block nerve cell neuronal transmission due to binding to voltage-gated sodium channels. Microcystins are cyclic heptapeptides that induce hepatotoxicity (9) (10).
Spirulina can significantly inhibit cytochrome P450 1A2 and 2E1 enzymes. The same study showed that it also led to significant increase in mRNA/protein levels of CYP2B1 and CYP3A1, but there was no change in the enzyme activities (20). Spirulina was shown to antagonize glioma cell growth in mice by down-regulating angiogenesis, which was mediated in part by regulating the production of interleukin (IL-17) (21).",,Spirulina platensis | Spirulina fusiformis | AFA-algae; Arthrospira platensis; Tecuitlatl; BGA,,Blue-Green Algae | Blue Green Algae | green algae (unspecified),Blue-green Algae,

Petasins, the sesquiterpene compounds found in butterbur, are thought to be the active constituents . Its leaf and root extracts have been shown effective in controlling migraines in adults and in children and asthma . Butterbur extract may also be effective against somatoform disorders . However, results from studies on allergic diseases are mixed. Some suggest that butterbur is effective against allergic rhinitis and comparable to standard antihistamine drugs , but conflicting data indicate that it is no better than placebo for intermittent rhinitis or for allergic skin disease . A systematic review suggests the need for more rigorous studies before recommending use of butterbur . Butterbur contains pyrrolizidine alkaloids that can cause hepatotoxicity .",,"Sesquiterpene petasin inhibits leukotriene and histamine activities, and is thought responsible for butterbur’s anti-inflammatory and antiallergic effects (15). Petasins were also shown to have calcium channel blocking effects (18) making them effective for migraine prophylaxis (1). The vasorelaxation effects of petasin may be via direct Ca(2+) antagonism of L-type voltage-dependent Ca(2+) channel (VDCC) in vascular smooth muscle (21).
In another study, a butterbur extract showed dose-dependent inhibition effect on cyclooxygenase (COX2) and prostaglandin E2 in vitro that was not correlated to the petasin content (16).",,Butterbur | Butter dock | Bog rhubarb | Exwort | pestilence wort | Devil's hat,,Butterbur,Butterbur,

DSI005225,Chia,C3256719,"The chia plant is native to Central and South America and the seeds it produces have been consumed as food since ancient times. They are high in dietary fiber, n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), and alpha-linolenic acid, and are marketed as a functional food or dietary supplement for cardiovascular health and weight loss. The seeds can expand and turn into a gel-like substance when mixed with water, and are often found in a variety of packaged goods touted as superfoods. Various laboratory analyses suggest that chia constituents have antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anticancer, and antithrombotic activities . In vivo experiments suggest that dietary consumption of chia seeds may improve animal intestinal health . In animal studies, chia prevented onset of dyslipidemia , reversed insulin resistance , and conferred cardio- and hepatoprotective effects . However, it did not reduce body weight gain or abdominal fat accumulation , or have preventive effects in animal tumor models . In preliminary clinical studies, chia did not benefit overweight adults , but appeared to improve cardiovascular and obesity-related risk factors in patients with type 2 diabetes . Other small studies suggest chia supplementation may increase short-term satiety , perhaps to a greater extent than flax , and has positive effects on blood glucose levels . Chia flour supplementation was found to reduce blood pressure in both treated and untreated hypertensive subjects . However, a systematic review determined that most studies on chia for CVD risk factors did not demonstrate statistically significant results . In addition, a meta-analysis of trials evaluating chia for various metabolic parameters determined that results were largely nonsignificant and modest at best for a few subgroup measures, while citing low quality of evidence . More research is needed to elucidate and validate health benefits with chia supplementation. Rare adverse or allergic reactions have been reported.",,"Active compounds in chia include essential fatty acids, flavonols, and phenolic compounds, some of which have antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anticancer, and antithrombotic activities (8) (17). Protein content of chia is higher than that of most traditional grains (18). The main protein fractions extracted from chia seed flour were globulins, with globulin peptides demonstrating homology to sesame proteins, and essential amino acids, especially methionine and cysteine (19).
In animal models, chia seed reversed impaired insulin stimulated glycogen synthase activity, glycogen, glucose-6-phosphate and GLUT-4 protein levels as well as insulin resistance and dyslipidemia (9).
Decreases in postprandial glycemia with chia supplementation may explain improvements in blood pressure, coagulation, and inflammatory markers observed in patients with type II diabetes (4) (11).
IgE-mediated anaphylaxis by chia seeds appeared to be caused by water- and lipo-soluble allergens including a lectin, an elongation factor, and an 11S globulin (18).",,Chia | Salba | Salba-chia,,Chia | Chia Oil,Chia,

It is used in traditional Chinese medicine to treat fatigue, impotence, constipation, frequent urination, and joint pain. It is a rich source of mucopolysaccharides, especially chondroitin sulfate, commonly used for arthritis. In vitro studies suggest saponins and fatty acids present in sea cucumber may have antiangiogenic, antitumor , antiproliferative , and antiviral properties . Studies in humans are quite limited, however. Preliminary findings suggest a sea cucumber extract may help chronic gingivitis , but clinical evidence for its use in any condition is lacking.",,"A branched-chain fatty acid known as 12-methyltetradecanoic acid, isolated from sea cucumber, is thought to inhibit prostate cancer cell proliferation by increasing caspase-3 activity (1). The proposed mechanism for the antiangiogenic and antitumor effects of Philinopside A, a saponin derived from sea cucumber, is by inhibiting tyrosine kinase receptors (2).

DSI005282,Conjugated Linoleic Acid,C1257880,"Conjugated Linoleic Acid (CLA) is a naturally occurring fatty acid found in the milk and meat of ruminant animals . CLA supplements have been marketed for weight control and to lower high cholesterol. Other purported uses include cancer prevention. CLA has different isomers that appear to have distinct characteristics, with anticarcinogenic effects more likely attributable to cis-9,trans-11 and antiobesity effects attributable to the trans-10,cis-12 isomer.In humans, studies on potential benefits are mixed. Preliminary data suggest CLA supplementation may improve some markers related to bone health in patients with rheumatoid arthritis . Other small studies suggest some benefit in COPD , as an adjunct to usual care in mild asthmatics , or antithrombotic or antiatherosclerotic effects in overweight adults . However, cis-9,trans-11 CLA supplementation decreased insulin sensitivity in obese men at high risk for cardiovascular disease , and short-term high-CLA intake did not affect blood pressure regulation in healthy volunteers . Another study also suggests no effects on antioxidant metabolism in overweight/obese individuals , and meta-analyses indicate proinflammatory effects . And although data suggest CLA can lower triacylglycerol levels , other studies indicate it can increase lipoprotein a and total-to-HDL cholesterol ratio, and lower HDL levels .Preliminary studies on CLA-induced changes in body composition and weight reduction are also mixed, with some yielding positive results while others do not show benefits . Although meta-analyses suggest effects on serum leptin levels in certain subgroups , it did not affect fasting blood glucose or waist circumference in healthy adults . CLA also did not impact aerobic capacity , aerobically-induced neuromuscular fatigue , or exercise performance .Animal studies suggest that CLA may play a role in reducing tumor proliferation in certain cancer cell lines . In models of colorectal cancer, CLA reduced inflammation and decreased disease activity . Preliminary human studies suggest anticancer effects with CLA in colorectal and breast cancers, but a meta-analysis found no association between CLA intake and reduced breast cancer risk . More studies in the context of clinical trials are needed.",,"Of several possible CLA isomers, cis-9,trans-11 and trans-10,cis-12 are the main isomers found in meat and dairy products, as well as commercial supplements. They appear to have distinct characteristics, with anticarcinogenic effects more likely attributable to cis-9,trans-11 and antiobesity effects attributable to trans-10,cis-12 (23).CLA reduced prostaglandin synthesis, especially PGE2 (12) (13), and decreased stearoyl-CoA desaturase activity (14). The trans-10,cis-12 isomer decreased serum HDL cholesterol levels (9), inhibited stearoyl-CoA desaturase activity (12), and decreased insulin-like growth factor-II secretion at both transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels (18).Laboratory and animal studies suggest that CLA has both anti- and pro-oxidant effects (40) (41). CLA may reduce abdominal adiposity through increased energy expenditure, while myocardial oxidative stress may occur through changes in transmembrane potential or the antioxidant defense system (40).In humans, CLA appeared to have a synergistic effect with a mixture of oleic and erucic acids in reducing neuroinflammation and enhancing peroxisomal beta-oxidation (42). In human skeletal muscle, CLA enhanced the rate of glycogen resynthesis after exercise (43).It is thought that replacing other polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) with CLA may reduce oxidative stress and modulate intracellular signaling (11). These effects may inhibit carcinogenesis and affect cellular responses to tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) (15). In vitro, CLA inhibited MCF-7 breast cancer cell proliferation, but the mechanisms by which this occurred for both isomers (trans-10,cis-12 and cis-9,trans-11) differed and require future elucidation (3). The cis-9,trans-11 isomer induced tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP)-1 and TIMP-2 mRNA in SGC-7901 human gastric carcinoma cells, which may play a role in inhibiting the tumor metastasis cascade (2). This inhibition may come from blocking the cell cycle with reduced expressions of cyclin A, B1 and D1 and enhanced cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor (CDKI) expression (17).In animal models of colorectal cancer, suppression of disease activity was attributed to peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARy) activation (36). Other possible mechanisms include increased apoptosis and enhanced caspase-3 activity in the colon mucosa (37). Preliminary studies in human breast cancers suggest anticancer effects occurred through suppression of fatty acid synthesis (39). In rectal cancer, CLA supplementation may improve markers of inflammation, and reduce angiogenesis and tumor invasion via matrix metalloproteinase-9 inhibition (38) (44).",Meat and dairy products,CLA,,Conjugated Linoleic Acid | Conjugated Linolenic Acid,Conjugated Linoleic Acid,

It is used in traditional Chinese medicine for a wide range of conditions including fatigue, sexual dysfunction, coughs, and as an adaptogen or immune stimulant. Preclinical studies show antitumor , radioprotective , antiplatelet and antidiabetic effects . In addition, cordyceps enhances recovery of mice with taxol-induced leukopenia and increases the cytotoxicity of cisplatin in non-small cell lung cancer cells . In clinical studies, cordyceps products improved renal function and reduced nephropathy in renal transplant patients and diabetes patients with renal insufficiency undergoing coronary angiography . However, several analyses found that evidence for its utility as adjuvant treatment in renal transplant recipients and hemodialysis patients is insufficient . Studies on exercise performance in healthy subjects yielded mixed results . Cordyceps may increase the adverse effects of antidiabetic or anticoagulant/antiplatelet drugs. Animal studies showed proliferation of progenitor red blood cells with cordyceps . Therefore, it should not be used by those with myelogenous type cancers. Cordyceps also stimulated testosterone production in mice . Whether it exerts similar effects in humans is not known.",,"Laboratory studies demonstrate that cordyceps stimulates T helper cells, prolongs lymphocyte survival, enhances TNF-alpha and IL1 production, and increases activity of NK cells (3). Enhanced proliferation of erythroid progenitor cells in murine bone marrow (8) and increased progesterone production in animal cells (5) have also been shown. Other experiments suggest cordyceps may inhibit tumor celIs by downregulating MHC class II antigen expression (7). Anecdotal data suggest reduction of cyclosporin and aminoglycoside-induced renal toxicity, although the mechanism of action is not known (4). Cordycepin, an active constituent in cordyceps, inhibits collagen-induced platelet aggregation by lowering calcium ion and thromboxane A2 activities (19).",,Vegetable caterpillar | Chinese caterpillar fungus | Dong chong xia cao | Semitake | Hsia ts'ao tung ch'ung | Yarsha gumba,,Cordyceps,Cordyceps,

DSI005450,Cayenne,C0873002,"Derived from the fruit of Capsicum, cayenne is among the most widely consumed culinary spice. Traditionally, it is used as a gargle for laryngitis and orally as a gastrointestinal stimulant. Oral formulations are marketed largely for digestive and circulatory problems, poor appetite, and weight loss. The active component, capsaicin, is also marketed for topical use to relieve various types of pain and for certain skin conditions (See Capsaicin topical formulations). Capsaicin may increase insulin and decrease blood glucose levels . Nonpungent capsaicin analogues can produce a stimulatory effect in humans, but their potential role in energy expenditure and weight management problems needs further clarification . In addition, the thermogenic and appetitive effects of capsaicin have been determined to be small . Oral capsaicin administered to participants in one study enhanced salty taste sensations, thereby lowering daily salt intake and subsequent blood pressure but a systematic review found no impact on blood pressure or heart rate . A preliminary study of enteric-coated oral capsaicin suggests it may decrease visceral hyperalgesia and improve bloating in patients with irritable bowel syndrome , but supplementation with capsicum for burning mouth syndrome was associated with significant GI side effects . Another study of oral capsaicin suggests it can alleviate oral mucositis pain from cancer therapy, but this relief was temporary and not complete . There is continued controversy over whether active constituents of capsicum act as a carcinogen, co-carcinogen, or anti-carcinogen , and effects may be concentration-dependent . In vitro studies have shown cytotoxic effects against breast , bladder , prostate , and oral cancer cell lines , and multidrug-resistant lymphoma . However, a human case-control study suggests an increased risk for gastric cancer with dietary capsaicin . Therefore, more studies are needed to clarify the roles of capsaicin in relationship to cancer.",,"Capsaicin is the compound responsible for the irritant effects of capsicum (10). Perceived heat from capsaicin when ingesting cayenne is caused by activation of transient receptor potential vanilloid subfamily member 1 (TRPV1), located in neurons on the tongue (4). Capsinoids lack this sensory quality because they are hydrolyzed as they cross the oral mucosa (4). Potential thermogenic effects also involve TRPV1-receptor activation on vagal afferents in the gut (4). Capsaicin may induce energy expenditure by enhancing core body and skin temperature and influencing substrate oxidation, but these effects can vary with body composition (3) (5). In response to high-salt stimuli, oral capsaicin administration enhanced insula and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) metabolic activity in participants, reversing salt intensity-dependent differences in the metabolism of the insula and OFC (29).
Vasodilator effects are attributed to the release of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP). Depletion in CGRP leads to a subsequent increase in blood pressure (21). Interactions between capsaicin and cyclosporin suggest modulation of P-gp and CYP3A gene expression and increased cyclosporin bioavailability via CYP3A inhibition (22). Lignan glycosides isolated from capsicum pepper appear to have strong scavenging activity against free radicals (20).
In vitro and animal studies suggest capsaicin causes cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis in both ER+ and ER− breast cancer cells by modulating the EGFR/HER-2 pathway (13). Orally administered capsaicin slowed prostate cancer cell growth by downregulating androgen receptor expression and inhibiting PSA transcription (15). In bladder cancer, capsaicin mediates cell death through ROS production and mitochondrial depolarization (14). Conversely in certain concentrations, capsaicin may promote colorectal metastasis by triggering ROS production and modulating Akt/mTOR and STAT-3 pathways (9).",Fruits of capsicum pepper,Capsicum | Red peppers | African chilies | Tabasco peppers | Mexican chilies | Louisiana long pepper | Pimiento,,Cayenne,Cayenne,

DSI005487,Chaparral,,"Chaparral is a plant prevalent in the desert regions of Mexico and southwest United States with a long medicinal history. Native Americans used extracts and preparations from this plant to treat skin sores, diabetes, cancer, venereal disease, tuberculosis, colds, and rheumatism. The aqueous extract, known as chaparral tea, has been employed for the treatment of kidney and gallbladder stones. A phase II clinical trial found chaparral to be ineffective as an anticancer agent . In another small retrospective study, low intake of chaparral tincture (<10%) did not cause adverse effects , but the association between length of exposure and risk is not known. Nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA), the active compound isolated from chaparral, has been investigated for its biological effects. In preclinical studies, it demonstrated antioxidant , anticancer , antiviral , antiparastitic , neuroprotective and renoprotective properties. It also had a protective effect against diet-induced metabolic function . However, studies in humans are quite limited. One pilot in patients with relapsed prostate cancer suggested NDGA was reasonably well tolerated and affected increases in PSA doubling time, but it was also associated with transaminitis in some patients . Several cases of reversible and irreversible liver damage have been associated with chaparral and products containing chaparral. NDGA, formerly employed as a food additive in low concentrations, has been removed by the FDA from its “Generally Recognized as Safe” (GRAS) substances list . Also Masoprocol, a topical cream containing NDGA for the treatment of actinic keratoses, was withdrawn from the US market in June 1996 . Chaparral is an ingredient in black salve, which is promoted as an alternative cancer treatment.",,"Nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA), a lipoxygenase inhibitor, may be responsible for the biological activity of chaparral. In vitro, it blocked cellular respiration (2). It also inhibited growth of estrogen receptor (ER) positive MCF-7 cells that overexpressed HER 2 (MCF-7/HER2-18), and had additive effects when combined with tamoxifen (13).
In murine models, NDGA exerted neuroprotective effects against ischemic/reperfusion injury mediated via suppression of the c-Jun N-terminal protein kinase pathway (14), and ameliorated potassium dichromate-induced oxidative stress and nephrotoxicity (15).",,Creosote bush | Greasewood | Hediondilla | Gobernadora,,Chaparral,Chaparral,

DSI005633,dhea,C0011185,"The most abundant hormone secreted by the adrenal glands, DHEA circulates in the blood as the sulfate ester, dehydroepiandrosterone-3-sulfate (DHEA-S). Both are precursors for other hormones, including estrogen and androgens . DHEA showed chemopreventive effects ; blocked the development of tumors ; and enhanced immune responses following hepatitis and influenza vaccinations in animal models. Although it has been postulated that DHEA may play a role in increasing immune response in acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) , no antiviral or immunostimulatory effects were observed in HIV-positive participants receiving DHEA . DHEA was reported effective in treating Addison’s disease , major depression , schizophrenia-induced anxiety , systematic lupus erythematosus , erectile dysfunction and osteoporosis . Additionally, low serum DHEA-S levels were found to indicate risk of non-vertebral fractures in older men . Topical application of DHEA in postmenopausal women increased sebum production and epidermal thickening in the hands and face , and oral use increased circulating estradiol levels . However, DHEA was ineffective in treating Alzheimer’s disease , obesity in adolescents , or perimenopausal symptoms . It also did not increase muscle mass or physical performance , improve cognitive performance , or enhance insulin secretion or action in elderly individuals. Supplementation, believed to enhance physical strength, did not improve physical performance or quality of life in a study done in older men and women . Conflicting data, however, suggest improvements in cognitive and physical function in older women. Findings also suggest DHEA may protect against hypoglycemia-associated neuroendocrine and autonomic failure and higher levels were associated with reduced risk of cardiovascular events .Studies on DHEA’s effects on sexual dysfunction in postmenopausal women are mixed . A review determined DHEA does not improve cognitive performance in this population but improved dyspareunia/genitourinary syndrome in menopausal women and in female cancer survivors , and conferred positive effects on vaginal cytology in postmenopausal women with breast or gynecologic cancers . Whether or not DHEA is effective in treating adrenal insufficiency remains unclear .Higher levels of DHEA have been associated with increased risk of ovarian and breast cancers in premenopausal women. Also, elevated DHEA-S levels contributed to tamoxifen resistance and disease progression in breast cancer . A case of cancer flare-up was reported in a patient with advanced prostate cancer undergoing DHEA treatment . In patients receiving androgen depletion treatment for recurrent prostate cancer, increases in serum DHEA and androsterone (AST) were associated with shorter time to castration-resistant prostate cancer .",,"DHEA is an endogenous hormone secreted by the adrenal cortex in response to adrenocorticotropin. DHEA is metabolized into androstenedione in the body and may be further converted into either testosterone or estrogen. Low levels of endogenous DHEA have been associated with the following disease states: burn trauma, coronary artery disease, non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, obsessive-compulsive disorder, rheumatoid arthritis, and systemic lupus erythematosus (5). Endogenous DHEA concentration peaks around 20 years of age and declines with age.DHEA has been shown to stimulate insulin growth factor-1 (1). G6PD is necessary for nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) production. DHEA has also been shown to increase levels of interleukin-2 in animal models (7). DHEA reduces the effects of inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-6, which are thought to reduce flares in systemic lupus erythematosus (11). Numerous studies have reported an inverse relationship between DHEA concentration and cardiovascular disease (5). DHEA administration improved mental function scores in patients with advanced HIV infection (32), enhanced influenza vaccination in elderly patients (6), and decreased oxidative stress markers in patients with type II diabetes in part by negatively influencing TNF-alpha signaling (33). Although DHEA-S concentration does not appear to be correlated with cognitive decline in aging men (34), the anti-depressive effects of DHEA may be mediated by GABAA receptor modulation (35). DHEA has also been shown to affect cytochrome P-450 enzymes in the liver (3). The exact effect that this will have on other drugs remains unclear.Analogs of DHEA that cannot be converted to androgens and estrogens have been developed and have demonstrated anti-proliferative effects (7) (31). DHEA inhibits glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) in vitro and blocks the development of tumors in mice (4). It was also shown to induce authophagic cell death in human hepatoma cells via a mitogen activated protein kinase (JNK)-transciption factor (Nrf2)-protein complex p62 axis (46).But an increase in concentration of sex hormones including DHEA has been shown to increase the risk of breast cancer (30). And prolonged intake of DHEA in postmenopausal women may increase the risk of breast cancer particularly in obese subjects (36). The sulfate ester DHEA-S also stimulates estrogen receptor-positive cell growth (28).",,DHEA,,"DHEA | Epiandrostenolone | 19-Nor-DHEA | 7-oxo-DHEA | 3-deoxy 7-oxo DHEA | 4-DHEA | 7-KETO-DHEA | 3-desoxy-7-KETO-DHEA | 7-Alpha-Hydroxy-DHEA | ""7b-hydroxy, 17b-dihydro DHEA"" | 7-Hydroxy-DHEA (unspecified)",Dehydroepiandrosterone,

DSI005678,Dong Quai,C1122975,"Dong quai is an herb, the root of which has a long history of use in traditional Chinese medicine. It is often combined with other herbs in formulations. Dong quai is also available as a dietary supplement and is promoted as a woman’s herb for menstrual and menopausal symptoms. Dong quai extracts demonstrated antitumor , pro-apoptotic , anti-metastatic , anti-tuberculosis (TB) , neuroprotective , and hematopoeitic effects in vitro. In animal models, polysaccharides extracted from dong quai root showed protective effects against cyclophosphamide-induced toxicity , doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity , and radiation-induced pneumonitis . Formulas containing dong quai improved clinical outcomes in patients with acute coronary syndrome and mild-to-moderate renal insufficiency , and prevented radiation-induced dermatitis in breast cancer patients . A systematic review determined benefits of dong quai against amenorrhea induced by antipsychotic drugs . Epidemiological data suggest positive associations between dong quai use and reduced risks of overall diabetes-related mortalities , and subsequent endometrial cancer in breast cancer survivors . Findings of its effectiveness against menopausal symptoms are inconclusive . Dong quai was also ineffective against hot flashes in men . Of note, dong quai showed estrogenic activity in vitro , stimulated proliferation of MCF-7 cells , and promoted growth of estrogen receptor-positive breast tumors in a murine model . Patients with hormone-sensitive cancers should consult with their physicians before using this herb.",,"Ferulic acid, a constituent of dong quai, may play an important role in treating osteoarthritis by reducing hydrogen peroxide-induced interleukin IL-1beta, tumor necrosis factor TNF-alpha, matrix metalloproteinases MMP-1 and MMP-13, and by increasing SOX9 gene expression. SOX9 is a protein involved in the establishment and maintenance of the phenotype of chondrocytes  (35). Dong quai polysaccharides demonstrated anti-osteoarthritic activity by stimulating insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) and IGF1 receptor gene expression, thereby promoting UDP-sugars and glycosaminoglycan synthesis (37). Another compound promotes wound healing and bone regeneration by inducing osteoblast proliferation and hyaluronic acid deposition (25).An aqueous extract from dong quai showed estrogen-agonist activity, and stimulated proliferation of both estrogen receptor-positive and -negative breast cancer cells (17). It also protected against radiation-induced pneumonitis by downregulating proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-alpha and TGF-beta1 in a murine model (14). Subcutaneous injection of dong quai extract protected mice against cyclophosphamide-induced cytotoxicity by promoting recovery from leukopenia (12). The antitumor effects of dong quai may be due to its inhibitory effects on invasion and metastasis of carcinoma cells (9) and by suppression of tumor growth (7) (8) (10) that may be mediated by Nur77-dependent apoptosis (23) (24). However, dong quai extracts also promoted angiogenesis – which plays a key role in both physiologic and disease processes – by inducing proliferation and migration of endothelial cells by upregulating VEGF expression (26).",,Chinese angelica | Dang gui | Tang kuei | Tan kue | Female ginseng,,Dong Quai,Dong Quai,

DSI005682,methylglycine,C0036228,"Dimethylglycine (DMG) is a derivative of the amino acid glycine. It is found naturally in plant and animal cells and in certain foods such as beans, cereal grains, brown rice, pumpkin seeds, and liver. DMG is produced in cells during the metabolism of choline and is considered an antioxidant and enhancer of oxygenation at the cellular level . Choline and DMG are present at higher levels in fetal versus maternal plasma . Plasma DMG levels have been found to be lower in children with cystic fibrosis than in healthy children . Animal studies on whether DMG can enhance immune response are mixed . Data in humans are also quite limited. A few studies suggest DMG may help enhance both humoral and cell-mediated immune responses . However, DMG had no effect on oxygen consumption in children with SLSJ-COX deficiency , and its use to treat seizures or autism stays controversial as limited clinical trials have yielded mixed results . In addition, a systematic review of supplements found no effects with DMG for autism symptoms . In a small long-term trial of patients with progressive multiple sclerosis, oral DMG also did not improve fatigue, cognition, gait performance, or disability status . DMG should not be confused with trimethylglycine (betaine), which is involved in the methylation of homocysteine to form methionine.",,"Choline and DMG are present at higher levels in fetal versus maternal plasma, suggesting that choline provides glycine via DMG for glutathione synthesis in fetal development (3).
Enhanced physical performance in animals with DMG supplementation may occur via improved oxygen utilization and reduced lactic acid formation. In humans, it is thought to enhance humoral and cell-mediated immune responses (2). No mechanisms have been uncovered to elucidate claims of DMG for autism, ADHD, epilepsy, chronic fatigue syndrome, or athletic performance enhancement. A recent metabolic analysis of healthy subjects correlated high plasma cholesterol levels with low levels for some metabolites related to mitochondrial metabolism including dimethylglycine (9).
DMG has been used as an ester to increase the solubility and bioavailability of a prodrug used in cancer research (10). However, DMG is not the active moiety and there is no evidence it has any antitumor effects.","Beans, cereal grains, brown rice, pumpkin seeds, liver",Dimethylglycine | Dimethylaminoacetic acid | N-methylsarcosine,,Dimethylglycine | DMG (Dimethylglycine) | Sarcosine,Dimethylglycine,

Its extracts have historically been used to treat fevers, rheumatism, appetite stimulation, arthritis, inflammation, and stomach disorders. Preclinical studies indicate that devil’s claw has antioxidant , anti-inflammatory , analgesic , anti-osteoporotic and appetite suppressant effects. Limited clinical data suggest benefits of devil’s claw/formulas containing devil’s claw for osteoarthritis of the hip or knee , knee pain , back pain , gonarthritis , and rheumatic disorders . Confirmatory studies are needed .",,"Harpagide, an iridoid glycoside isolated from devil’s claw, is responsible for the herbs’s anti-inflamamtory effects. It was shown to inhibit the production of inflammatory cytokines including interleukins IL-1beta, IL-6, and tumor-necrosis factor (TNF-alpha) in mouse macrophage cells (15). A devil’s claw extract also demonstrated anti-inflammatory activity via inhibiting the induction of pro-inflammatory gene expression, possibly by blocking the activator protein (AP-1, a transcription factor) pathway (9).
Harpagide may also prevent bone loss by regulating the stimulation of osteoblast differentiation and the suppression of osteoclast formation in  mice (17). In another study, it was shown to block lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced bone loss in a model of inflammatory osteoporosis. However, harpagide was not effective in preventing bone loss mediated by ovariectomy in postmenopausal osteoporosis (18).
Investigations of the mechanisms underlying the pain-releiving activity of devil’s claw showed involvement of the heme oxygenase-1/carbon monoxide (plays a role in nociceptive processing) system in carrageenan-induced inflammatory pain (22). Devil’s claw  exerts antioxidant effects by scavenging both superoxide and peroxyl in a dose dependent manner (5).

DSI005737,Ephedra,C0390643,"Derived from the dried rhizome and root of the plant, ephedra has been used as a medicinal herb for thousands of years in India, China and Japan. It is commonly consumed in low doses and in combination with other herbs to promote urination, to treat asthma, bronchitis and coughs. Ephedrine and pseudoephedrine, the major constituents, are non-selective sympathomimetic agents with both alpha and beta activities, and have direct as well as indirect central nervous system (CNS) stimulation effects, which account for the medicinal properties of the herb. In preclinical models, ephedra demonstrated antibacterial and anti-inflammatory properties . Although ephedra is widely promoted as a natural stimulant and as an appetite suppressant, a systematic review cited insufficient evidence to support its use for weight loss . Additional preliminary data suggest an ephedrine alkaloids-free ephedra extract may be safer compared to ephedra extract, which causes adverse effects such as excitation, insomnia, and arrhythmias , and a formula containing ephedra used alone or combined with NSAIDs reduced disease activity in active ankylosing spondylitis patients . Misuse and overdose of ephedra have resulted in heart attack, stroke, seizure, psychosis and death . The FDA has banned the sales of dietary supplements that contain ephedra because of their significant risk to human health . However, a review of 51 websites found nearly 20% sold weight loss products that potentially violated the ban of ephedra alkaloids .",,"The major alkaloids in ephedra, ephedrine and pseudoephedrine, are CNS stimulants. They are non-selective sympathomimetic agents with both alpha and beta activities. These alkaloids can be used as decongestants because they constrict peripheral blood vessels, but in high doses, they also raise blood pressure (1) (2) (3). The CNS stimulation property contributes to ephedra’s appetite suppressant effects and its reputation as a weight loss agent (7). This effect, however, may lead to other cardiovascular adverse reactions such as stroke and heart attack (8). Ephedra’s antiasthmatic effect arises from its ability to relax bronchial smooth muscle. Studies indicate that ephedra also has antibacterial, anti-inflammatory and uterine stimulatory activities (9).",,Mahuang | herbal ecstasy,,Ephedra,Ephedra,

DSI005770,Epimedium,C1084567,"Epimedium is an herb used in traditional Chinese medicine to treat fatigue, arthritic pain, nerve pain, and sexual dysfunction. It is thought to alter levels of certain hormones and is marketed as a dietary supplement for libido. Epimedium showed antiosteoporotic , neuroprotective , immunomodulatory , and anticancer effects , as well as anti-HIV activity in preclinical studies. Epimedium derivatives also produced radiosensitizing effects and reversed multidrug resistance in tumor cells. Small controlled studies and a systematic review suggest benefits of Epimedium for post-menopausal osteoporosis but not for relieving symptoms of Gulf War Illness . Other published trials tend to combine this herb in a botanical “recipe,” confounding the determination of any specific contributions from Epimedium or its components. Further, the safety of such phytotherapeutic compounds needs to be determined. Patients with hormone-sensitive cancers should use Epimedium with caution as it demonstrated estrogenic effects . Cancer patients may experience sexual dysfunction symptoms including painful intercourse, loss of libido, and difficulty in maintaining arousal. These problems are often multifactorial and can be caused by stress, distress, and hormonal changes, as well as treatments involving surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, or hormone therapy. Therefore, patients should consult and be monitored by a physician to properly address individual symptoms of sexual dysfunction.",,"Icariin, a major active constituent of Epimedium, promotes estrogen biosynthesis, and enhances aromatase mRNA and protein expression as well as alkaline phosphatase activity in vitro (1). However, other studies have attributed estrogen-like activity to icariin derivatives icaritin and desmethylicaritin, rather than icariin itself (14). Icariin can also exhibit a mild phosphodiesterase-5 inhibition effect (16). It has been implicated in differentiation of stem cells into cardiomyocytes via cell cycle regulation, induction of apoptosis, modulation of reactive oxygen species generation, and the regulation of various signaling pathways (17). In undifferentiated neuronal cell lines, it exhibited neuroprotective effects through LDH leakage attenuation which reduced GSH depletion, prevented DNA oxidation damage, and inhibited caspase-3 and p53 activation; and inhibited JNK/p38 MAPK pathways (4). Icariin was also shown to reduce viability of  human esophageal cancer cells by regulating apoptotic signaling, which is mediated by endoplasmic reticulum stress (23).
Icaritin, a prenylflavonoid derivative, induced sustained activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway and apoptosis in both breast (9) and endometrial cancer cells (18). It also induced G2/M phase cell-cycle arrest and downregulated G2/M regulatory protein expression (9). Its radiosensitizing effects suggest ERK1/2 and AKT pathway suppression, enhanced apoptosis, and induced G2/M blockage (11). Also, icaritin may reverse doxorubicin resistance in human hepatoma cells by increasing intracellular drug accumulation, and by decreasing MDR1 and P-glycoprotein expression (12). In another study, addition of an epimedium extract to gefitinib was shown effective against drug resistance caused by T790M mutation in non-samll cell lung cancer cells (24).",,Horny Goat Weed | Yin Yang Huo | Inyokaku | Herba Epimedii,,Epimedium | Epimedium extract,Epimedium,

DSI005929,Feverfew,C0376266,"Feverfew is a plant that belongs to the daisy/sunflower family. It is widely used in traditional medicine for the treatment of fevers, migraine headaches, rheumatoid arthritis, stomach ache, toothache, insect bites and infertility. Although much of its activity is attributed to the compound parthenolide, a parthenolide-free extract of feverfew demonstrated free radical-scavenging properties, affording protection against UV-induced sun damage . Feverfew extracts also possess antiprotozoal , antibacterial , anti-inflammatory , and antioxidant properties. In clinical studies, a feverfew extract reduced the frequency of migraine attacks ; a formulation containing feverfew was reported useful in decreasing the duration of aura ; and a feverfew/ginger formula prevented mild headache before the onset of moderate to severe headache in patients with migraine . In another study, a combination of feverfew and acupuncture treatments led to greater improvements in quality of life in women with migraine, compared with feverfew or acupuncture alone . A systematic review found the overall evidence of efficacy for migraine to be mixed, citing the need for high-quality research . In another study, feverfew did not benefit patients with rheumatoid arthritis . In addition, parthenolide demonstrated anticancer effects in vitro . A phase I clinical study involving cancer patients showed that up to 4 mg of parthenolide was well tolerated; however, it could not be detected in the plasma . Consequently, a synthetic analog dimethylamino-parthenolide (DMAPT), a more hydrophilic form of parthenolide, with greater bioavailability was identified. Oral administration of DMAPT has been found to be safe, and resulted in increased plasma concentrations in an animal model . More studies are warranted.",,"The sesquiterpene lactones, particularly parthenolide, are the active constituents responsible for feverfew’s beneficial effects. Parthenolide attenuates activation of the NF-kappa B complex to block transcription of inflammatory proteins (21). The inhibition of this pathway also leads to decreased platelet activity (22). Other mechanisms that produce antiplatelet activity by parthenolide include sulfhydryl group alterations, changes in protein kinase C interactions, and arachidonic acid metabolism (22) (23) (24). The flavonol content also has anti-inflammatory effects (25) (26).
In vitro studies suggest various activities induced by parthenolide can produce antiproliferative effects. In colorectal cancer cells, it suppresses angiogenesis by reducing VEGF and VEGF-receptor expression. (10) In cervical and breast cancer cell lines, parthenolide modulates apoptosis-regulating gene expression (11) and activates both apoptosis pathway and AMPK-autophagy survival pathway through ROS generation (12). In glioblastoma cells, it induces caspase 3/7-mediated apoptosis independent of NF-kappa B suppression (27). Parthenolide sensitizes the tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) leading to apoptosis via activation of both caspases 8 and 3 in hepatocellular carcinoma cells (17).",,Featherfew | Santa Maria | wild chamomile | wild quinine,,Feverfew,Feverfew,

DSI005944,Forskolin,C0917964,"Forskolin is a diterpene derived from the root of Coleus forskohlii. It has been used for centuries in Ayurvedic medicine to treat a variety of conditions including heart disease, respiratory disorders, and hypothyroidism. However, studies are quite limited and only a few actually use forskolin as an oral supplement. Laboratory studies suggest it has inotropic and antiplatelet properties . In animal models, forskolin promoted activation of adenylate cyclase and increased intracellular concentrations of cyclic adenosine monophosphate . Treatment of uropathogenic E.coli-infected mice with forskolin reduced bacteria . Small clinical studies suggest that forskolin may help weight management or reduce asthma attacks . When administered intravenously or inhaled, forskolin had a bronchodilation effect . Preliminary findings also suggest intraoperative infusion of forskolin may benefit cardiovascular health due to anti-inflammatory effects or that intraarterial forskolin daropate may improve cerebral vasospasm in patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage . Forskolin and its derivatives showed anticancer effects . When applied on the skin of mice, forskolin stimulated production of melanin in the absence of ultraviolet light . It has been proposed for use in sunless tanning lotions to reduce skin cancer risk by decreasing sun exposure. A forskolin extract reduced viral production in human lymphoid CEM-GFP cells infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1NL4) . However, these effects have yet to be confirmed in clinical studies.",,"Forskolin activates adenylate cyclase through direct stimulation and modulation of enzyme activities, leading to increased intracellular concentrations of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) (1). This may explain bronchodilation (4) (5) (6), inotropic (7), vasodilatory (16), and antiplatelet (11) effects. Forskolin also increased cellular acetylcholinesterase and protected neuronal cells from organophosphate toxicity (17).
Preclinical studies suggest forskolin and derivatives may inhibit cell proliferation, and induce cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in human gastric cancer cells (18) (19). Forskolin upregulated expression of cytochrome P450 3A family via the pregnane-X-receptor that regulates CYP3A genes (20) (21).",,Makandi | Colforsin,,Forskolin,Forskolin,

DSI006010,Gotu Kola,C2948088,"Gotu kola is an evergreen perennial plant that is prevalent in East Asia and many parts of South Africa. Extracts from the leaf and whole plant are used for a variety of conditions including venous insufficiency, varicose veins, wound healing, scleroderma, and scars. Preclinical data suggest neuroprotective , chemopreventive , and antioxidant properties . The active constituent madecassoside may also have cardioprotective and antiarthritic effects . Topical application of an asiaticoside extracted from gotu kola appeared to enhance burn wound healing . Only a few studies have been conducted in humans, however. Data show a reduction in lower extremity edema with gotu kola compared to placebo in patients with chronic venous insufficiency . With respect to wounds, one study suggests an oral extract may speed healing in diabetic patients . In small studies of topical products, gotu kola improved symptoms in burn wound patients , but did not prevent or delay radiodermatitis in breast cancer patients undergoing treatment . Other small studies suggest that oral supplementation with gotu kola may alleviate generalized anxiety disorder and improve cognitive function and mood in the elderly , although a meta-analysis did not find strong enough evidence to support its use . Larger well-designed studies are needed to confirm these effects. Gotu kola should not be confused with kolanut. Gotu kola does not contain any caffeine and has not been shown to have stimulant properties.",,"Triterpenoids have been identified as active constituents. Asiaticoside demonstrates anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting lipopolysaccharide-induced fever and inflammatory response, including production of serum TNF-alpha, IL-6, PGE2, liver myeloperoxidase activity, and expression of brain COX-2 protein (23). Asiaticoside also promotes wound healing by stimulating collagen and glycosaminoglycan synthesis and angiogenesis (6). Another study showed that a gotu kola extract may regulate stress-induced premature senescence by preventing repression of DNA replication and mitosis-related gene expression (24).
A water extract of gotu kola prevented the formation of intracellular beta-amyloid aggregates in a mouse model of Alzheimer’s disease with high amounts of beta-amyloid (25).",,Indian pennywort | Hydrocotyle | Mandukaparni | Madecassol | TECA,,Gotu Kola,Gotu Kola,

DSI006060,Goldenseal,C0330270,"Derived from the root of the plant, goldenseal is a North American botanical with origins as a traditional remedy among Native Americans. It has historically been used for skin and eye irritations, as a bitter tonic, and to improve digestive function. Purported properties have led to its use for a variety of ailments including the common cold, fever, infections, constipation, and muscle spasms. Goldenseal is also marketed as an antioxidant and is often combined with echinacea in supplements to support immune function. Studies on goldenseal and its compounds are limited. The primary active constituents are hydrastine and berberine. Among several herbs tested in vitro, goldenseal extract was the most active growth inhibitor of H. pylori . Studies of berberine suggest that it has antimicrobial , cytotoxic, and apoptotic effects . Other animal studies have suggested potential liver toxicity with goldenseal root, but this occurred at very high doses over long-term ingestion . Laboratory studies demonstrating phototoxicity suggest this would be more likely from topical rather than supplement use . Clinical studies are lacking and would be needed to determine safety and efficacy.",,"The active characteristics of goldenseal are attributed to the compounds hydrastine and berberine, in which most laboratory studies have been conducted. In human prostate and breast cancer cells, berberine induced cell cycle arrest (2) (4). At the same time, tumorigenicity in rodents from long-term high-dose ingestion of goldenseal root powder is partly attributed to the topoisomerase inhibition properties of berberine or its metabolite (26), although the comparative doses are unlikely in humans. Still, DNA damage in liver cells via topoisomerase inhibition was attributed to berberine in goldenseal and was also observed with commercial goldenseal products, with the extent of DNA damage positively correlating with berberine content (27).",,Goldenroot | Eye root | Turmeric root | Yellow paint root,,Goldenseal,Goldenseal,

Extracts of the plant are traditionally used alone or in combination with other botanicals to treat various disorders including rheumatism, arthritis, neurological diseases, hemorrhoids, urinary disorders, and skin diseases. Preclinical studies suggest that the compound guggulsterone has antiangiogenic and antitumor properties . In an animal study, guggul had cardioprotective effects . Studies in humans are limited, but suggest guggul may be effective for hypercholesterolemia . However, other trials indicate uncertain benefit or that guggul may actually raise cholesterol levels . It also showed no benefit when taken with Triphala, an Ayurvedic formulation . Additional research is needed to determine safety and efficacy.",,"In vitro, guggulsterone affected biosynthesis of cholesterol in the liver (2). Cholesterol-lowering activity in mice was attributed to inhibition of FXR, a nuclear hormone receptor that is activated by bile acids. FXR mediates a negative feedback loop to decrease bile acid production by the liver. This loop is an important component of cholesterol metabolism regulation (10). In humans, hypolipidemic outcomes may be better for those with a higher capacity to metabolize Z-guggulsterone with moderate carboxylesterase induction (19).
In tumor cells, guggulsterone induced apoptosis by activating JNK (5) and repressing Akt signaling (6).
Guggulsterone activates nuclear receptors such as estrogen receptor alpha, pregnane X receptor, and progesterone receptor and may induce CYP3A genes (8).",,Gum guggal | Gum guggulu | Guggal,,Guggul,Guggul,

Lab studies suggest anti-inflammatory and antitumor properties . However, studies in humans have not been conducted. Both pyranocoumarins as well as furanocoumarins such as imperatorin, psoralen, and bergapten have been indentified in glehnia . Theoretically, glehnia may have phototoxic effects or CYP3A4 interactions due to furanocoumarin components. Additional research is necessary to determine the safety and efficacy of this botanical.",,"Reports suggest that glehnia root can hemolyze blood cells, stimulate myocardial contractility, and exert antibacterial effects (8). Studies in mice demonstrated analgesic effects with glehnia root extracts (2). An intraperitoneal injection of a glehnia extract inhibited topical edema and reduced inflammation, vascular permeability, cytokine production, and neutrophil-mediated myeloperoxidase activity (1). Anti-inflammatory effects may be due to inhibition of proinflammatory mediators such as NO, prostaglandin E2, TNF, and IL1-beta via suppression of NF-kappaB- and mitogen-activated protein kinase-dependent pathways (9). Imperatorin, a compound isolated from glehnia root, blocks protein expression of inducible NO synthase and COX-2 in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 macrophages (11).
Polyacetylenic compounds extracted from glehnia fruit may have antiproliferative activity against human gastric adenocarcinoma, human uterine carcinoma, and murine malignant melanoma cancer cell lines (3).",,Bei sha shen | Hamabofu | American silvertop root,,Glehnia root,Glehnia,

Whereas trace amounts can be found in some foods, it is not thought to be essential for normal body functions. Both inorganic and organic germanium products, which have different biological activities, have been promoted to treat a wide range of diseases including cancer and AIDS. Germanium compounds have immunomodulating and antioxidant activities . Spirogermanium, an azaspiran compound, was investigated as an anticancer drug. Severe renal, hepatic, myelogenous, and neurologic toxicities have been reported . Germanium sesquioxide (Ge-132), an organic compound that is supposed to have lower toxicity, has been marketed as a dietary supplement to help fight cancer. In a single case study, tumor remission was reported following oral supplementation . However, there is no conclusive evidence showing this compound is an effective cancer treatment. The status of a 2011 phase II clinical trial of germanium to reduce radiation-induced fatigue in cancer patients is unknown and has not produced any results . There are concerns of contamination of germanium products by the toxic inorganic germanium dioxide. The FDA has issued warning letters to marketers of germanium about unsubstantiated claims. Importation of germanium for human consumption is not allowed .",,The atomic structure of germanium allows it to act as a free-radical scavenger (1).

Hops is also used as an herbal medicine for mood disturbance and insomnia and to treat menopausal symptoms. In vitro studies suggest hops has antibacterial , chemopreventive , antitumor , antiangiogenic , anti-inflammatory , phytoestrogenic , and antidiabetic properties. In murine models, hops reduced hyperlipidemia and obesity , and protected against bone loss following estrogen depletion . In clinical studies, a hops-valerian combination product was reported to improve sleep quality and insulin sensitivity in patients with type-2 diabetes . Other preliminary studies suggest hops extracts may alleviate mild depression, anxiety, and stress or decrease body fat in healthy subjects . Data from an observational study suggest a combination of hops, rosemary extract, and oleanolic acid may help reduce arthritic pain . However, it is not clear whether hops alone would exert similar effects. In postmenopausal women, a few studies suggest hops extracts may alleviate menopausal symptoms and improve bone health . Some studies also indicate that derivates of hops have phytoestrogenic effects . Patients with hormone-sensitive cancers should consult their physicians before using products containing hops.",,"Animal models suggest isomerized hops extracts may increase plasma HDL levels and decrease atherosclerosis index via PPAR-alpha activation (14). These extracts also reduced plasma triglycerides and induced hepatomegaly (8). A product containing hops extract reduced C-reactive protein in patients with inflammatory diseases (12).
Prenyl flavonoids from hops, xanthohumol, isoxanthohumol, and 8-prenylnaringen (8-PN) inhibit aromatase activity and breast cancer cell proliferation, increase apoptosis (5), and inhibit prostate cancer cell proliferation (3). 8-PN is among the potent estrogen receptor alpha phytoestrogens, which is likely responsible for relief of menopausal symptoms (29). In addition, xanthohumol exhibits antiangiogenic effects by inhibiting the NF-kB and Akt pathways (6). Isoadhumulone, isocohumulone, and isohumulone derived from hops selectively inhibited aldo-keto-reductase 1B10, which is upregulated in various cancers promoting carcinogenesis (30).
Isoxanthohumols are converted in the distal human gut into 8-PN via intestinal microflora activity (12). This process also occurs in the liver and is regulated by CYP450 enzymes (15).",Female inflorescences of Humulus lupulus L.,"

DSI006225,Horse Chestnut,C0331000,"Horse chestnut, a tree native to the Balkan Peninsula, has been used in traditional medicine for centuries. The seed extract is used as a dietary supplement to support vascular function. Horse chestnut should not be confused with sweet chestnut. Lab studies suggest that aescin, or escin, in horse chestnut has anti-inflammatory , neuroprotective , and antitumor effects, and may enhance gemcitabine efficacy . Data from earlier trials suggest horse chestnut seed extract has efficacy against chronic venous insufficiency and is safe and well tolerated , but a Cochrane review of rutosides did not find any clear evidence of benefit for post-thrombotic syndrome . Other studies suggest aescin may improve sperm quality in patients with varicocele-associated infertility . Patients with compromised renal or hepatic function should not consume horse chestnut products.",,"Aescin, a natural mixture of triterpenoid saponins isolated from the seed of horse chestnut, has been identified as the active principle. Its anti-inflammatory effects involve downregulation of inflammatory gene expression and upregulation granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor production, which also confers neuroprotection (1).
Aescin may reduce chronic venous insufficiency via inhibition of elastase and hyaluronidase, both involved in enzymatic proteoglycan degradation, which constitutes part of the capillary endothelium and is the main component of the extravascular matrix (19). Contraction of veins and arteries with horse chestnut may be partially mediated through 5-HT(2A) receptors (20). It also reduced platelet aggregation in vitro (20).
Beta-aescin and 5-fluorouracil inhibited human hepatocellular carcinoma cells, perhaps via synergistic effects including cell-cycle arrest, induction of apoptosis, caspase-3, -8 and -9 activation, and Bcl-2 downregulation (17). Escin potentiated gemcitabine efficacy in part through NF-κB inhibition and consequent inhibition of c-Myc, COX-2, cyclin D1, survivin, Bcl-2, and Bcl-xL, and caspase-3 activation (18).",,Chestnut | Marron europeen | Escine | Escin | Aescin,,Horse Chestnut | Red Horse Chestnut,Horse Chestnut,

A compound isolated from Hoodia was shown to reduce food intake in rats . However, consumption of a hoodia extract did not affect body weight in healthy overweight women . Currently, supplements containing Hoodia are being promoted for weight loss and some cancer patients use these for weight control. Patients should use caution as hoodia can interact with certain prescription drugs. The FDA has warned the manufacturer and distributors of a Hoodia product against making unsubstantiated and misleading claims about weight loss .",,"Hoodia extracts are thought to have an appetite suppressant effect, but it is not clear what causes such an effect. In an experiment done in rats, intracerebroventricular administration of P57 resulted in an increase in ATP level in hypothalamic neurons. It is hypothesized that neurons in the basal hypothalamus may be sensitive to changes in ATP levels and regulate food intake (1). P57 also inhibited CYP 3A4 activity (5) (6).
In another study, pregnane glycosides specifically suppressed steroidogenesis by strongly inhibiting 11β-hydroxylase and steroid 17-alpha-monooxygenase, and weakly inhibiting cytochrome P450 side chain cleavage enzyme and 21 Beta-hydroxylase (9).",,Xhoba | P57 | Carrion plant | Queen of the Namib; African Hats,,Hoodia,Hoodia,

DSI006345,Kratom,C1197867,"Mitragyna speciosa, commonly known as kratom, is indigenous to Southeast Asia. The leaves have been used in traditional medicine to treat pain, fatigue, fever, diarrhea, and wounds , while its extracts are known for their psychoactive properties, especially morphine-like effects . Kratom has gained popularity as a supplement to improve mood, and decrease anxiety and pain. It has also been a source of significant controversy. The FDA has issued numerous statements against kratom, citing adverse events, potentially related deaths, risk of addiction or overdose, and incidences of contaminated supplements . Kratom has both stimulant and sedative properties . The main psychoactive constituents are mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine . In vivo studies of derivative compounds and analogs from kratom demonstrate antinociceptive effects . Animal models suggest that kratom has muscle relaxant , anti-inflammatory , analgesic , and anorectic properties. Mitragynine has also shown antioxidant and antiproliferative effects in a few cancer cell lines . Data on the use and safety of kratom in humans are very limited. Stimulant effects occur at lower doses, while sedative and pain-relieving effects occur at higher doses . Kratom users may develop physiological dependence and experience withdrawal , but this risk has not yet been adequately quantified . More research on the therapeutic uses for kratom and its constituents, as well as its toxic effects and abuse potential is needed. The biological activities of kratom in humans are still poorly characterized . Because of its potential interactions with other drugs and possible side effects , kratom should not be used as a substitute for prescription pain medications. Several countries and US states have banned the use of kratom due to its potential for abuse .",,"The main active alkaloids in kratom are mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine, which is thought to have analgesic effects comparable to morphine (11) (23). Through monoaminergic and opioid receptors, both compounds produce a range of CNS stimulant and depressant effects (23) (24) (25).
Although structurally different (26), mitragynine administration causes cognitive impairment and addiction profiles that closely resemble those of morphine (27). Other research also suggests these compounds share classic opioid characteristics — affinity for opioid receptors, analgesic cross-tolerance, and competitive interaction with naloxone — while possessing other novel attributes (28).
In animal models, anxiolytic-like effects are attributed to opioidergic, GABAergic, and dopaminergic interactions in brain regions (29). Mitragynine may also obstruct neuronal calcium channels (30).",,Kratom; Cratom | Ketum; Kakuam | Biak | Mitragyne; Mitragyna; Mitragynine | Thang; Thom,,Kratom,Kratom,

It is used as a social beverage in those areas and to relieve anxiety, stress, and insomnia. Kavalactones in kava are thought to be the active constituent that produces skeletal muscle relaxation, non-narcotic anesthesia, and local anesthetic effects. Clinical data suggest moderate benefits with kava as short-term use for generalized anxiety disorder , and no differences in withdrawal or addiction versus placebo . Several other studies also support the use of kava for relieving anxiety , but a recent double-blind placebo-controlled trial did not find benefit . Although it has been suggested as an alternative to benzodiazepines, an internet-based study suggests that kava is not superior to placebo in reducing anxiety , and a randomized clinical trial reported similar findings . While a systematic review showed that kava does not have negative effects on cognition , there have been case reports of impairment consistent with CNS depressant effects, including slow, slurred speech and flaccid muscle tone . In addition, due to concerns of hepatotoxicity, the Canadian, French, and British governments withdrew availability of kava and kava-containing products . The Food and Drug Administration has advised consumers about the potential risks of liver injury associated with kava consumption. However, following a World Health Organization recommendation to study aqueous extracts of kava, initial research results support the benefits of kava . Case analyses of 14 patients with hepatic injury resulting from kava use revealed low-quality products, overdose, prolonged use and co-medication as causative factors . Additional studies are needed to confirm these findings. Kava consumption has been associated with low cancer incidence , but one of its constituents was shown to stimulate growth of melanoma cells .",,"Kavapyrones are centrally-acting skeletal muscle relaxants, anticonvulsants, and peripherally-acting local anesthetics. There are conflicting data on the effects of kavapyrones on CNS levels of dopamine and serotonin (14). Possible hepatotoxicity mechanisms are thought to be CYP450 inhibition, reduction in liver glutathione content, or inhibition of COX activity (4) (15).
In vitro and in vivo studies suggest that kavapyrone- and pipermethystine-containing extracts induce mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and apoptosis of Hep2G cells (16) (17). The major constituent kavain was found to potentiate GABAA receptors (38).
Kava enhances acetaminophen-induced cytotoxicity by increasing glutathione depletion, resulting in oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction, ultimately resulting in cell death (35).",,Kava-kava | Kawa | Kavain | Rauschpfeffer | Tonga | Yaqona,,Kava kava,Kava,

Lycium is also used with other botanicals for poor vision, anemia, and cough . It is marketed as a superfood that is high in antioxidants. Preclinical studies suggest that a polysaccharide isolated from lycium has antitumor , immune-enhancing , neuroprotective , and radiosensitizing , as well as hepato- and photoprotective effects. In addition, lycium appeared to inhibit growth of ER-positive breast cancer cells and reduce doxorubicin-associated cardiotoxicity . Studies in humans are limited. Preliminary data suggest improved well-being in healthy subjects , and hypoglycemic effects in type-2 diabetic patients . Other analyses point to the potential that lycium may have for liver disease, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes . A small study on lycium added to a healthy diet also suggests it may further improve HDL cholesterol levels . Protective effects on macula in elderly subjects have been described , and analysis of a lycium-containing formula suggests it might be a helpful adjuvant for dry eye , but additional studies are needed. Data from an observational study suggest that when used with certain cancer treatments, lycium polysaccharides may exert beneficial effects . However, despite marketing claims of cancer-preventive potential, the efficacy and safety of lycium products for cancer treatment have yet to be established.",,"Lycium is rich in carotenoids and polysaccharides (38). The bark and berries contain betasitosterol, which can prevent cholesterol absorption in the gastrointestinal tract (7). The hepatoprotective effects of lycium polysaccharides (LBP) are in part via modulation of transcription factor NF-κB and MAPK pathways and autophagy (6). In another study, LBP antioxidant effects against insulin resistance were attributed to PI3K/AKT/Nrf2 pathway activation (24). It also exerted protective effects against focal cerebral ischemic injury by attenuating the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway (25). In murine models of acute pancreatitis, LBP reduced inflammation by upregulating NRF2 and HO-1 (30). Protective effects against diabetic peripheral neuropathy is thought to be mediated via autophagy induction (31).
LBP inhibited the growth of leukemia HL-60 cells (2) and increased expression of IL-2 and TNF-alpha (3). Antiproliferative effects may occur via activation of extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases (20). In H22 tumor-bearing mice, LBP alleviated immunosuppression and maintained antitumor immune responses (32).
Allergenic potential of goji berries has been attributed to cross-reactivity with lipid transfer protein from other foods (22).",Goji berries,Gou qi zi | Goji | Wolfberry | Box thorn | Matrimony vine,,Lycium,Lycium,

It has been used in folk medicine as a sedative , to reduce gastrointestinal problems , and for its CNS-depressant effects . Lemongrass is also consumed as a tea and used in aromatherapy. Preclinical studies suggest lemongrass has many properties including antimicrobial , anxiolytic , and vasorelaxant effects. Limited data in humans suggest lemongrass essential oil products might help chronic periodontitis and oral thrush . In other studies, lemongrass tea did not reduce anxiety or benefit sleep . High doses or long-term use of lemongrass tea may have adverse effects on renal function .",,"Preclinical studies suggest antioxidant properties may help prevent endothelial dysfunction via NO-independent vasodilator effects (46). Anxiolytic activity of lemongrass appeared to be mediated by the GABAergic system (35).

DSI006405,Lentinan,C0023324,"Lentinan, a polysaccharide, is derived from the mycelium of the shiitake mushroom body, and its active component is 1,3 beta glucan. In some countries, parenteral lentinan is classified as an antineoplastic polysaccharide and is available for clinical use. Only oral formulations and extracts, which are considered dietary supplements, are available for use in the United States.Although lentinan is a biological response modifier, it does not have a direct cytotoxic effect on tumor cells . In various cancer models, lentinan enhanced activity of gemcitabine , paclitaxel , docetaxel and cisplatin , and monoclonal antibodies . Addition of lentinan to standard cancer therapies improved survival in hepatocellular and gastric cancers, and the quality of life in patients with esophageal carcinoma , and non-small cell lung cancer . Meta-analyses also suggest benefits of adjuvant lentinan in advanced or gastric cancers .Improvements in quality of life were seen with an oral formulation of lentinan in some cancer patients . Larger, well-designed studies are needed to establish the role of lentinan as a useful adjunct to cancer treatment.",,"Lentinan’s active polysaccharide, 1,3 beta glucan, is not cytotoxic but seems to enhance T-helper cell function and increase stimulation of interleukin, interferon, and normal killer cells (3) (4). In addition to their primary structures, immunopotentiation activity of beta-D-glucans is linked to their molecular weight and triple helical conformation, which varied greatly between batches and manufacturers (23).In vivo studies suggest that 1,3 beta glucan increases IL-4-producing cells, suggesting a stimulation of Th2-mediated immunity (5). In addition to antitumor activity, lentinan also possesses immune-regulatory effects, antiviral activity, antimicrobial properties, and cholesterol-lowering effects (6).In murine bone marrow cells, lentinan enhanced repair of paclitaxel-induced DNA damage and protected against paclitaxel-induced apoptosis partly via modulation of cellular antioxidant levels (24). Lentinan also was shown to induce apoptosis in gastric cancer cells, and this effect was enhanced when combined with docetaxel and cisplatin (16). In urothelial bladder cancer cell lines, increased concentrations of lentinan alone or combined with gemcitabine correlated with enhanced T24 cell apoptosis (18). Lentinan cotreatment with paclitaxel enhanced effects in a lung cancer cell line through ROS production and activation of NLRP3 inflammasome and ASK1/p38 MAPK signal pathway (19).",,Shiitake | Hua gu; Snake butter; Forest mushroom | Pasania fungus,,Lentinan,Lentinan,

DSI006563,Milk Thistle,C0872906,"Derived from the seed, pod, or fruit of milk thistle, the flavolignan silymarin is used primarily to manage various liver diseases. Preclinical studies suggest flavonoids in milk thistle have antioxidant and anticancer effects , and may protect against Alzheimer’s disease . Supplementation with milk thistle or silymarin improved lipid profiles and glycemic indices in type 2 diabetic patients and biomarkers related to obesity and its comorbidities . It may also be useful against alcoholic liver disease , cirrhosis , for improving fibrosis associated with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis , and for reducing risk of anti tuberculosis drug-induced liver injury . However, in both a large survey and a subsequent multi-center trial of patients with chronic hepatitis C, silymarin did not significantly reduce serum ALT levels , and despite its association with reduced progression from fibrosis to cirrhosis, had no impact on clinical outcomes . Milk thistle was also reported ineffective against trichotillomania but topical use may accelerate wound healing following episiotomy and improve severity of acne . Small studies suggest benefits of milk thistle in reducing chemo-induced hepatotoxicity in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia and in non-metastatic breast cancer patients ; and radiation therapy-induced mucositis in those with head and neck cancer . Topical use of a silymarin gel decreased the severity of capecitabine-induced hand-foot syndrome in GI cancer patients and radiodermatitis in patients with breast cancer . Both silymarin and silibinin have estrogenic effects with greater affinity for estrogen receptor (ER-beta), and activation of ER-beta results in suppression of cell growth. Silibinin can also exacerbate the negative effects of chronic alcohol consumption on liver cancer .",,"Animal models suggest that silymarin confers hepatoprotection via downregulation of extracellular matrix proteins such as collagen (2). It may also be useful against liver carcinogenesis by inhibiting mast cells, a source of matrix metalloproteins that are involved in invasion and angiogenesis (29). In addition, silymarin reduced cisplatin-induced kidney damage in rats without diminishing the drug’s antitumor activity (7), and suppressed formation of amyloid beta-proteins and neurotoxicity in mice (30).
Silibinin, one of the flavonoids, demonstrated antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting release of hydrogen peroxide and production of tumor necrosis factor alpha (31). Another study showed improvement in endothelial dysfunction via reduction in circulating and vascular asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) levels. ADMA is an endogenous inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) and is believed to play a role in endothelial dysfunction, associated with cardiovascular disease (32). Silibinin also inhibits the early phase of hepatitis C viral infection by affecting endosomal trafficking of virions (34).
Other studies indicate milk thistle flavonoids exert anticancer effects by arresting G1 and S phases of the cell cycle (8). Silybin inhibited hepatocellular carcinoma cell growth via the Notch signaling pathway (36). Silibinin suppressed the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-induced expression of CD44, the transmembrane receptor for hyaluronan implicated in tumor cell invasion and metastasis by inhibiting EGFR activity in breast cancer cells (33). Suggested mechanisms for reduced efficacy of silibinin in liver tumor-bearing animals that were co-administered ethanol include impaired hepatic processing of silibinin (10).
Silybin and isosilybin were shown to strongly inhibit PXR-mediated CYP3A4 induction (35).",,Holy thistle | Lady's thistle | Mary thistle | Marian thistle,,Milk Thistle,Milk Thistle,

DSI006641,Mate,,"Mate is a plant native to South America. It is widely consumed as a hot beverage known as chimarrão, and is also used in traditional medicine. Mate is valued for its stimulatory effects and promoted as a dietary supplement for weight loss, cardiovascular diseases, and cancer prevention. In vitro studies indicate that mate has antioxidant and cardioprotective properties . Animal models also suggest antiadipogenic and antilipidemic effects . Studies in humans are limited. One product containing mate delayed gastric emptying in overweight patients , and other data in generally healthy women suggest consumption may have short-term effects on caloric intake and appetite regulation . However, higher bodyweight has been observed in a large population of heavy mate drinkers . Studies on mate for bone health are also mixed . In various cancer models, mate compounds exhibited proteasome and topoisomerase inhibitory properties, as well as anti-inflammatory and apoptotic effects . However, no large-scale clinical studies have evaluated safety and efficacy of mate in humans. Further, epidemiologic data show that chronic mate drinkers are at an increased risk of prostate , bladder , esophageal , lung , and head and neck cancers . This risk appears to be additive when combined with chronic alcohol or tobacco use . Evidence also suggests that drinking very hot mate contributes to its carcinogenic effects , although consuming large amounts can increase risk regardless of temperature .",,"In vitro studies suggest antioxidant and antimicrobial activity of mate may be due to its polyphenolic content (1) (22) (26), while cardioprotective effects occur through the regulation of nitric oxide (2). Caffeine, theophylline, and theobromine are the xanthines in mate largely responsible for its stimulatory effects (21) (22) (23) (24) (25).
In animal models, mate regulates adipogenesis through the Wnt pathway (3), reduces lipid peroxidation, improves endothelial function and LPL and HL activities, and modulates lipogenic gene expression (4). Thermogenic properties are related to enhanced expression of uncoupling proteins, while increased fatty acid oxidation is linked to AMPK phosphorylation in visceral adipose tissue (27).
Anticancer activities of mate extract may occur through proteasome (8) and topoisomerase (9) inhibition. It also reduced DNA damage from oxidative stress (1). In human colon cancer cells, saponins and phenolics in mate demonstrated anti-inflammatory activity and induced apoptosis through caspase activation (10) (11). However, other carcinogenic constituents in mate and high temperatures used for brewing could facilitate their solubility and absorption (19) (25) and thus explain associated increased cancer risks.",,Yerba mate | St. Bartholomew’s tea | Jesuit’s tea | Ilex | Hervea | Guyaki Paraguay tea | Chimarrão | Cimmaron,,Mate,Mate,

DSI006689,Neem,C3541937,"Azadirachta indica or neem is a tree prevalent in South Asia. The bark, leaves, flowers, and seeds have been utilized as food and medicine for centuries. In Ayurvedic medicine, neem is used externally for skin conditions, internally for gastrointestinal ailments, and for oral hygiene. Several forms of neem extracts are marketed as dietary supplements. Neem has antimicrobial activity and is used against a wide range of pests and parasites . It is effective against lice and has antiretroviral activity . Neem also reduces plaque and decreases oral bacterial counts , but data are conflicting . Its extracts were found to have anti-secretory and anti-ulcer properties , and to improve glycemic control in patients with metabolic syndrome . Neem may also be effective in the treatment of cholera and diarrhea . A few studies have examined the anticancer potential of neem. An ethanolic extract of neem leaves reduced the incidence of chemical-induced gastric tumors in mice , and neem-treated monocytes induced apoptosis in cervical and prostate cancer cells . Neem also showed chemopreventive effects in animal models . However, human data are lacking. Although rare, case reports of poisoning and other severe adverse effects have been associated with the ingestion of neem oil.",,"The ulcer-healing properties of nimbidin from neem seeds are attributed to the stearic and palmitic acid components (14). Anti-ulcer effects are believed to be via inhibition of the proton pump, H+- K+- ATPase, to control secretion of hydrochloric acid and gastric mucus depletion, and prevent oxidative mucosal damage (6).
Azadirachta in neem has pestical activity due to its growth-regulating properties, reducing levels of the insect hormone ecdysone (14).
Neem induces cell death in prostate cancer cells by decreasing the levels of Bcl-2, an anti-apoptotic protein. Neem-treated monocytes induce apoptosis in cervical cancer cells by increasing levels of caspases 3, 8 and 9, interferon (IFN-gamma), and by decreasing tumor necrosis factor (TNF-alpha) (10). Neem also acts as an antiretroviral agent via inhibition of viral invasion of host cells (5).",,Margosa oil | Neem oil,,Neem,Neem,

DSI006707,Nattokinase,C0131956,"Nattokinase is an extracelluar enzyme secreted by the bacterium Bacillus subtilis, used to ferment boiled or steamed soybeans resulting in a preparation called nattō. Nattō has been consumed as food in Japan for several centuries. Nattokinase is also available as a supplement and is most known for its effects on prevention and treatment of clots and to improve blood circulation. Preliminary studies have explored its antithrombotic and amyloid-plaque degrading abilities . Nattokinase decreases platelet aggregation and thrombus formation in a dose-dependent fashion both in vitro and in vivo . Reduced intimal thickening was observed in the femoral artery of rats that were fed a diet containing nattō . Studies in humans are limited. In a randomized double-blind trial, nattokinase capsules reduced diastolic and systolic blood pressure in prehypertensive patients . However, long-term nattokinase supplementation had a null effect on subclinical atherosclerosis progression and associated biomarkers in a study of healthy individuals at low risk for cardiovascular disease . In subjects with hypercholesterolemia, nattokinase altered hemostatic factors . Other preliminary data suggest it may be helpful as adjuvant therapy in the rehabilitation of stroke patients , but more study is needed. Nattokinase has been promoted as an alternative anticancer treatment based on the notion that it can help dissolve the fibrin coating around a tumor, and increase oxygen supply in the blood to inhibit cancer cell growth. However, these mechanisms have not been proven in humans. Theoretically, nattokinase may increase bleeding risk when used with anticoagulant, antiplatelet, and fibrinolytic drugs. Raw nattō contains high levels of vitamin K that may interfere with the action of warfarin .",,"In vitro studies show that nattokinase decreases clot formation by cleaving and inactivating the plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI) via proteolysis at P1-P1’ peptide bond. PAI is a key inhibitor of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) that converts plasminogen to plasmin. PAI inactivation allows for greater tPA activity and increased lysis of clots (10) (11). In the absence of PAI, nattokinase affects direct proteolysis of fibrin; however, this effect is less than the protelysis achieved by the PAI-mediated pathway (2). The fibrinolytic activity of nattokinase is estimated to be four-fold that of plasmin (12).
Nattokinase is currently being evaluated for its potential as an amyloid plaque-degrading agent. Low doses of nattokinase have been shown to increase expression of the ADAM10 gene, which belongs to a family of proteinases that degrade the amyloid precursor protein. Upregulation of ADAM10 may shift the amyloidogenic pathway to the non-amyloidogenic pathway. This activity may prevent amyloid plaque accumulation that characterizes Alzheimer’s disease (9).",Nattō (soybeans fermented with B. subtilis),Natto extract | Fermented soybeans,,Nattokinase,Nattokinase,

DSI006721,Noni,C1010822,"Noni is an evergreen plant found throughout Polynesia. It bears fleshy yellow-white fruit and is used in traditional medicine for wound healing, infections, diarrhea, skin conditions, and as a tonic. It is also cultivated in Hawaii and other Polynesian islands and is marketed worldwide. Fresh or fermented juices are available as drinks while capsules, pills, and powders are sold as dietary supplements. In preclinical studies noni extracts and its constituents demonstrated antibacterial , antifungal , anti-inflammatory , antidiabetic , hepatoprotective , prokinetic , antitumor , and immunomodulatory properties. Noni also inhibited low-density-lipoprotein oxidation and may be useful in preventing arteriosclerosis ; improved memory in animal models ; and activated cell-mediated immunity . Glycosides, iridoids, and other constituents isolated from noni fruits and leaves exhibited antioxidant properties . In addition, noni juice exerted antiangiogenic effects in an ex vivo assay ; along with altering oxidative stress markers and expression of DNA repair genes in cervical cancer cells . Small clinical studies suggest that noni may help reduce incidence of early postoperative nausea , alleviate cigarette smoke-induced dyslipidemia , and improve hangover symptoms . An extract containing noni, D-mannose, and N-acetylcysteine (NAC) may be useful in the prophylaxis of urinary tract infections associated with urological diagnostic procedures . Further research is needed to confirm these effects. Morinda citrifolia should not be confused with Morinda officinalis, also known as Ba Ji Tian, commonly used in Chinese medicine.",,"Glycosides isolated from noni juice inhibit AP-1 transactivation and cell transformation in mouse epidermal JB6 cell lines (2). Antidiabetic characteristics of some noni compounds are attributed to inhibition of the protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B enzyme (35). Anti-inflammatory activity in noni extract was attributed to quercetin (34). In addition, noni juice exhibited antioxidant effects by reducing aromatic DNA adducts (5) (19).
In animal models, an aqueous extract of noni root produced a central analgesic effect that was antagonized by naloxone (6). Hepatoprotective effects occur through regulation of lipid homeostasis, antioxidant status, and anti-inflammatory responses (36) (37). The primary iridoid deacetylasperulosidic acid may exert antioxidant effects by increasing superoxide dismutase activity (42). Scopoletin and rutin in noni may be responsible for antidopaminergic and antiadrenergic effects (46). Scopoletin also stimulates gastrointestinal motility by acting as a 5-HT4 receptor agonist (38). Treatment with noni extract prevented memory impairment through increased brain energy metabolism, cholinergic neurotransmission, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, and antioxidative activity (40).
When combined with suboptimal doses of certain chemotherapy agents, polysaccharides from noni improved survival time and curative effects (4). Apoptotic effects occur via upregulation of p53 and proapoptotic Bax proteins, as well as downregulation of the antiapoptotic Bcl-2, Bcl-XL proteins and survivin. Increase in caspase 9 and 3 was also reported, which suggests involvement of the intrinsic mitochondrial pathway (31). In cervical cancer cell lines, malondialdehyde levels were significantly reduced when treated with noni, alone or in combination with cisplatin alone (44). The antitumor effects of damnacanthal from noni are attributed to its inhibitory effects on the HGF/c-Met axis in human hepatocellular carcinoma cells, with decreases in Akt phosphorylation and matrix metalloproteinase-2 secretion (39). Noni extract induced apoptosis, G1/S phase cell-cycle arrest, and decreased intracellular ROS generation and mitochondrial membrane potential in breast cancer cells (47).",,Lada | Indian mulberry | Nono | Hog apple,,Noni,Noni,

DSI006799,Pennyroyal,,"An essential oil or tea derived from the leaves and flowering tops of the plant, pennyroyal was used in folk medicine to induce abortion, alleviate menstrual symptoms, and to treat inflammatory conditions, chronic bronchitis, and minor ailments. The oil itself is highly toxic, and is not recommended for internal use. Pennyroyal oil contains several monoterpenes, principally pulegone, to which toxic effects on the liver and lungs are attributed. Oxidative metabolites of pugelone such as menthofuran are oxidized further by cytochrome P450 to reactive intermediates that form adducts with cellular proteins and cause organ damage . Ingestion of pennyroyal oil in adults or tea in children causes severe toxicities , including hepatic and renal failure, metabolic acidosis, pulmonary congestion, cerebral edema, seizures, bleeding and clotting disorders, and death.",,"Pennyroyal’s abortifacient properties are thought to be due to irritation of the uterus, causing contractions, but lethal doses are necessary for this to occur and the effect is inconsistent. Pennyroyal’s mint properties, attributable to the menthol component, theoretically may act in dilating respiratory passages in bronchitis or asthma when consumed as a tea (5). European and American pennyroyal oil consist of 80-90% and 16-30% (R)-(+)-pulegone, respectively, which is oxidized by CYP450 to menthofuran (about 50%) and other toxic metabolites (4). The menthofuran is further oxidized to an epoxide which is likely the ultimate toxic biological reactive intermediate that causes liver damage (15). Animal and human studies also show that pulegone is neurotoxic. Menthofuran is known to decrease glucose-6-phosphatase activity in rat models, causing hypoglycemia (1).",,Squaw mint | Mosquito plant | Squaw balm | Tickweed,,Pennyroyal,Pennyroyal,

DSI006906,Probiotics,,"The term “Probiotic” (Greek for “prolife”) came into being in the 1960s to define substances produced by protozoa, which support the growth of other microorganisms . Following revisions over the years, probiotics are currently defined by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the World Health Organization as “live microorganisms, which when consumed in adequate amounts, confer a health effect on the host” . Most probiotics consist of lactic-acid producing, non-virulent bacteria, such as Lactobacillus, Streptococcus, Bifidobacterium, Propionibacterium and Enterococcus or non-pathogenic yeasts such as Saccharomyces boulardii. Probiotics have gained immense popularity over the last two decades for their perceived health benefits which include improved digestion, immune function and nutrient absorption but the most important being the reversal of dysbiosis (changes in the function or composition of gut microbes or “microbiota”) that is hypothesized to play a role in the development of several chronic and degenerative diseases . Although gut microbiota is known to develop at birth, nutrition, lifestyle, and changes in the host genome during later years can shift its makeup and activity, which in turn influences overall health and the risk of developing disease. Antibiotic use has also been associated with gut microbiota disruption in general population, increasing the risk of chronic disease ; in patients undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation , with the greatest shifts occuring between stem cell infusion and reconstitution of healthy immune cells ; as well as in allogeneic bone marrow transplantation patients . Furthermore, antibiotics were found to inhibit the benefits of immune checkpoint-inhibitors in patients with advanced cancer ; and patients who were administered antibiotics before, and not during, immune checkpoint-inhibitor therapy had worse treatment response and overall survival . Research is underway to determine strategies for modulating the gut microbiome to improve immune response in cancer. Probiotic supplements are currently promoted for the prevention and treatment of inflammatory bowel disease, gastroenteritis, irritable bowel syndrome, allergies, dental cavities, and for managing diarrhea induced by antibiotics, by the bacterium Clostridium difficile (C. difficile), and that associated with chemotherapy . The strongest evidence of effectiveness of probiotics is for acute infectious diarrhea . Supplementation also was shown useful in alleviating antibiotic-associated diarrhea . Although RCTs did not find benefit for managing C. difficile-associated diarrhea , data suggest effectiveness in preventing C. difficile infection and for pouchitis (inflammation of the ileal pouch in post-colectomy patients). Interestingly, even though a range of products were shown useful in treating and sustaining remissions of mild to moderately active ulcerative colitis, findings on Crohn’s disease are not promising . Based on the association of intestinal bacteria with symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), supplementation has been explored in a few studies with promising findings but well-designed trials are lacking . In a study of patients with systemic sclerosis, probiotics did not improve gastrointestinal symptoms . Analyses of the National Health and Nutrition survey results revealed consumption of yogurt or probiotics reduces the risk of proteinuric kidney disease , but definitive conclusions of benefit against urinary tract infections or bacterial vaginosis are lacking. Probiotic use was also shown to increase resistance to risk factors associated with dental caries in an RCT , and to improve memory impairment in a murine model . Probiotics conferred a moderate benefit for eczema prevention but not for other allergic conditions . Supplementation also reduced glycemic and inflammatory markers in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease . But evidence to support its role in managing cystic fibrosis is lacking . In other studies, supplementation did not prevent influenza in women healthcare workers , nor bacterial vaginosis in pregnant women , but shortened the healing time in patients with lactational breast abscesses . As increasing evidence indicates that gut bacteria are important determinants of metabolic disorders, probiotics are being investigated as a possible therapeutic option. Thus far, benefits were reported against obesity and diabetes . Meta analyses suggest that supplementation helps reduce periodontal parameters and halitosis associated with severe periodontitis , helps prevent oral candidiasis in the elderly , may lower fasting blood glucose level in adults and improve lipid metabolism by lowering the levels of LDL and total cholesterol . Another important application of probiotic therapy is in pediatrics for the treatment of gastrointestinal disorders and allergies. Meta analyses indicate enteral supplementation is effective in preventing severe necrotizing enterocolitis in preterm infants . A significant reduction in acute diarrhea was also reported in children, independent of the bacterial strains employed . Additional studies showed efficacy of probiotics against antibiotic-associated diarrhea and for lowering the incidence of eczema in late infancy . But available evidence does not support use for allergic diseases , and data are insufficient to assess effects in children with short bowel syndrome, a malabsorption disorder . Preliminary studies indicate that probiotics may also have anti-carcinogenic potential. Oral administration of Lactobacillus casei BL23 had a protective effect against dimethyl hydrazine-induced colorectal cancer , and a probiotic mixture attenuated the growth of hepatocellular carcinoma . A murine melanoma model suggests that manipulating microbiota may modulate cancer immunotherapy by enhancing antitumor immunity through administering a Bifidobacterium strain . Gut microbiome may also modulate responses to anti PD-1 immunotherapy in melanoma patients . Epidemiological data suggest an association between consumption of non-pasteurized dairy products and lower incidence of colorectal cancer . Probiotics may also aid in controlling symptoms associated with cancer treatments: Systematic reviews found supplementation to affect reductions in the severity and frequency of treatment-associated diarrhea, and the need for anti-diarrheal medication in cancer patients ; and to promote recovery of gastrointestinal function following gastrointestinal cancer surgery and craniotomy ; In colorectal cancer patients, perioperative probiotic treatment reduced surgical site infections , improved bowel function , and a systematic review concluded that probiotics/synbiotics help modulate enteric microbiota, improve postoperative outcomes, gut barrier function and reduce inflammatory parameters . Probiotics may also help prevent chemo-related cognitive impairment in breast cancer patients ; decrease severity of chemo- and radiotherapy-induced oral mucositis in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma ; and reduce oral Candida following radiotherapy in patients with head and neck cancer , although supplementation was ineffective in preventing radiation-induced mucositis . A systematic review evaluating probiotics in oncological surgery found substantial risk of bias across majority of the studies analyzed, warranting the need for well-designed studies . Additional strategies used to modulate gut microbiota include “prebiotics” and “fecal microbiota transplantation” (FMT). Prebiotics or functional foods are non-digestible food ingredients that benefit the host by selectively promoting growth or activity of helpful gut bacteria. Currently used prebiotics include the fructans inulin and fructo-oligosaccharides (FOS), galacto-oligosaccharides (GOS), and lactulose. Data on prebiotics for IBS are conflicting . Because probiotics are short-lived, prebiotics are being co-administered to maintain their levels in the gut, and this combination is called “synbiotic therapy”. It was reported useful in controlling symptoms associated with IBS ; and may also benefit gut functioning in healthy community-dwelling elders . FMT involves administration of fecal matter from a healthy donor into a recipient by enema, colonoscopy or through the upper gastrointestinal tract in the form of oral capsules, via nasogastric, nasoduodenal or nasoenteric tube, or by endoscopy, to restore normal gut flora. FMT may benefit IBS patients although the quality of evidence is low . In oncology settings, FMT was found effective against immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI)-associated colitis ; and autologous fecal microbiota transplantation (auto-FMT), for reestablishing intestinal microbiota composition in patients with gut microbiota depletion due to antibiotic treatment during allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation . A synbiotic mouthwash was effective in reducing and preventing oral mucositis intensity in oral cancer patients undergoing radiotherapy . Synbiotic supplements also reduced chemo-induced diarrhea in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia . In summary, available data suggest probiotics may improve certain health outcomes by inducing favorable changes in the intestinal bacteria. But the overall evidence to support their use is limited due to small sample size, poor methodology, variation in the species and strains of bacteria, and in the dosage and duration of administration. Variation in the response to probiotics is also an important factor to consider because genes that respond to probiotic intake were shown to be strain-specific and to cluster according to the individual and not by intervention . Furthermore, gut colonization is not always achieved despite supplementation with probiotics . In another study that examined post-antibiotic recovery in humans, administration of probiotics was associated with a delay in gut-microbiome reconstitution . Well-designed studies and specific recommendations are needed to establish probiotic use for different age groups and disorders, and to determine long-term safety. Of note, early observational data suggest that indiscriminate use of commercially available probiotics may be harmful in the setting of immune checkpoint blockade treatment in cancer patients .",,"Proposed mechanisms by which probiotics influence colonization in the gut include production of inhibitory compounds to suppress the growth of pathogenic microorganisms, and production of substrates to promote the growth of beneficial bacteria. Probiotics can also indirectly influence shifts in microbiota by interacting with the mucosal system, which affects systemic immunity; and by reducing pro-inflammatory markers implicated in many disorders (34) (35).
Studies using murine models indicate that administration of S. boulardii to type-2 diabetic and obese mice resulted in reduced inflammation, body weight, fat mass, and hepatic steatosis, along with decreased bacterial population that has been previously associated with obesity and type-2 diabetes (36). Probiotic treatment also affected a reduction in food intake and an improvement in glucose tolerance via release of the hormone glucagon-like protein-1 (GLP-1), a physiological regulator of appetite and food intake (37).
Immunomodulation is one of the ways in which probiotics are thought to influence host health. A subspecies of Bifidobacterium longum prevented Salmonella-associated infection in mice by inducing T-regulatory cells and by attenuating the activation of nuclear factor-kappa B, which plays a role in the expression of pro-inflammatory genes (38). Induction of T-regulatory cells was also shown in humans along with a reduction in pro-inflammatory biomarkers (39). In addition probiotic administration was shown to reduce pain perception, and to induce changes in the colonic expression of genes that mediate pain and inflammation (40). And a probiotic mixture reduced the growth of hepatocellular carcinoma by shifting the gut microbes toward beneficial bacteria, which produce anti-inflammatory metabolites (24). Protective effects of probiotics were also reported in a murine model of mammary carcinogenesis. Oral administration of a supplement containing Lactobacillus reuteri resulted in inhibition of mammary tumor formation by triggering CD4+/CD25+ lymphocytes, which play a critical role in controlling immune responses (41). Because intestinal bacteria have been shown to influence carcinogenesis and response to anticancer therapy, manipulating them selectively may be a potential strategy to enhance the efficacy of anticancer treatments (66).","Yogurt, miso, tempeh, kefir, pickled vegetables, sauerkraut, kimchi and buttermilk","

In vitro and in vivo studies indicate that pygeum extracts have bactericidal and fungicidal activity , antagonize the androgen receptor , and have antiproliferative and apoptotic effects against prostate cancer cells . Clinical studies suggest effectiveness of pygeum and formulations containing pygeum and other herbs to improve urinary symptoms associated with BPH. However, additional larger studies are needed to demonstrate usefulness of pygeum compared with standard treatments in current use for BPH.",,"Pygeum antagonizes 5-lipoxygenase metabolite production, and this action may contribute to its anti-inflammatory effects (15). Antimicrobial effects have been linked to inhibition of IL-7 mRNA expression (2).
The isolated compounds atraric acid and N-butylbenzene-sulfonamide were identified as androgen receptor antagonists, which play an important role in the development of prostate diseases (16).
Antiproliferative and apoptotic effects of pygeum on prostate fibroblasts and myofibroblasts are due to downregulation of transforming growth factor B1 and inhibition of fibroblast growth factor 2-specific signaling (6).",,African plum tree,,Pygeum,Pygeum,

DSI007133,Red Yeast Rice,C0763533,"Used in China as food and medicine for thousands of years, red yeast rice is the fermented product of the fungus, Monascus purpureus, grown on rice. It was first marketed as a dietary supplement in the United States by Pharmanex under the trade name Cholestin . The active constituent, monacolin K, is the same as lovastatin, an active ingredient in the cholesterol-lowering drug . A number of clinical trials have demonstrated effectiveness of red yeast rice preparations in reducing cholesterol levels in hyperlipidemic patients , but meta-analyses are mixed on whether it is safe , with one citing a lack of regulation and standardized formulations. One of the extracts tested also did not lower blood pressure in hypertensive patients . In another study, co-supplementation with Coenzyme Q10 was found to be associated with improved LDL-cholesterolemia and endothelial reactivity in moderately hypercholesterolemic subjects . It is important to note that several preparations of red rice yeast contain citrinin, a toxic fermentation byproduct .",,"Components such as citrinin, monacolines and monankarin, and monascopyridines have been isolated from red yeast rice (10). Fermentation products are standardized to contain 0.4% 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors. HMG-CoA reductase is the rate-limiting enzyme in endogenous cholesterol biosynthesis (1).

DSI007199,Soy,,"Soybeans are rich in protein and other essential nutrients and are widely consumed as food. Soy also contains significant amounts of isoflavones including genistein, daidzein, and glycitein. They are marketed as dietary supplements for hot flashes, high cholesterol, cardiovascular health, and cancer prevention. Soy isoflavones exhibit both selective estrogen receptor modulator activity and non-hormonal effects. Studies are mixed on whether soy can relieve menopausal symptoms or slow bone loss . Other analyses suggest no protective effects against diabetes , and lack of benefit in patients with Alzheimer’s disease or poorly controlled asthma . However, there may be cardiovascular benefits with soy products as studies show soy intake lowers blood pressure and cholesterol levels . Soy has also been evaluated for anticancer effects. Although it may reduce risk of prostate , lung , and endometrial cancers, high or prolonged intakes may increase risk of bladder cancer , endometrial hyperplasia , and mortality . Prior soy intake was associated with prolonged survival among women with lung cancer , but no associations were found between soy and risk of liver or colorectal cancers. Studies in breast cancer patients are mixed. Although it may help prevent breast cancer or recurrence , or reduce mortality , soy intake or supplementation did not modulate risk , decrease overall risk . Data are also conflicting on whether it affects mammographic density . Other findings suggest potential adverse effects or that supplementation can stimulate overexpression of breast cancer genes in some patients . Soy supplementation was also not helpful against prostate cancer progression , for high-risk patients post-surgery , or for treatment-related hot flashes . Other limited data suggest isoflavone supplementation may reduce some side effects from radiation or chemotherapy , but larger studies are needed. Preclinical data suggest higher intakes of soy or specific isoflavones may promote growth or metastasis or antagonize the effects of tamoxifen . Patients should consult their physicians about the use of soy supplements, whose long-term safety remains to be determined.",,"Soy isoflavones may modulate bone remodeling via estrogen receptors (ER) by regulating target gene expression (49). Isoflavones may inhibit LDL oxidation and alter hepatic metabolism with enhanced removal of LDL and VLDL by hepatocytes (13). Serum lipids may also be regulated via modified transcription factor and downstream gene expression and by promoting antioxidant enzyme activity (50).
Various mechanisms have been proposed for soy’s anticancer effects. Genistein affects microRNA expression-targeted translation inhibitors for multiple proteins implicated in regulating various pathobiological processes (51). It also demonstrated an anti-minichromosome maintenance effect, a gene family upregulated in various cancers and considered a promising drug target (52).
In breast cancer cells, genistein acts as an agonist in ER-alpha-predominant cells, but likely acts as an antiestrogen in cells with ER-beta alone, suggesting therapeutic potential for premenopausal women with ER-alpha-negative/ER-beta-positive tumors (53). However, genistein induces estrogen-dependent MCF-7 tumor cell growth and increases breast cancer-associated aromatase expression/activity, suggesting that soy-based supplements may affect aromatase inhibitor efficacy (54). Genistein is also known to negate tamoxifen’s inhibitory effect on MCF-7 tumor growth and increase expression of estrogen-responsive genes (47). Some benefits ascribed to dietary isoflavones may depend on early life exposure, thereby impacting gene expression at the epigenetic level (55).
In prostate tumors, soy protein reduced androgen receptor expression (56). Both genistein and daidzein affect microRNA regulation (57) and induce decreased methylation of gene promoters including BRCA1 (58). In TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand-resistant prostate cancer cells, soy isoflavones enhance TRAIL-mediated apoptosis by engaging apoptotic pathways and regulating NF-κB activity (59). However, in a patient-derived prostate cancer xenograft model, increased proliferation and metastasis in genistein-treated groups were linked to enhanced activities of tyrosine kinases, EGFR, and its downstream Src (45). Both genistein and daidzein also act as radiosensitizers for prostate cancer, but pure genistein increased lymph node metastasis, whereas the combination of genistein, daidzein, and glycitein did not. Daidzein may protect against genistein-induced metastasis, and its ability to inhibit cell growth and potentiate radiation appears to be androgen-receptor-independent (60). In addition, soy isoflavones radiosensitized human A549 NSCLC cells, and decreased hemorrhages, inflammation, and fibrosis caused by radiation suggesting protection of normal lung tissue (61).","Raw soybeans, low-fat soy flour, roasted soybeans, dry-roasted soy beans, soy milk, tofu, and soy protein isolate.

Stevia extract is many times sweeter than table sugar , but only purified steviol glycosides have the Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) status by the FDA for use in food . Preclinical studies show that stevia has anti-inflammatory , hepatoprotective and renoprotective effects . Small clinical studies found stevia to reduce hypertension and hyperglycemia , but a meta-analysis of steviol glycosides on type 2 diabetes biomarkers did not find significant benefit . In an RCT comparing low-calorie sweeteners, ingestion of rebaudioside did not appear to affect body weight . Additional studies are needed to clarify any benefits.",,"Mechanisms of purported antihypertensive effects with stevioside are unclear, although it may act as a calcium channel antagonist, similar to the drug verapamil (9). Other studies suggest steviosides are metabolized in the gut where bacteria provide an aglycone metabolite that then enters the blood circulation (16).
In vitro studies suggest stevioside suppresses production of inflammatory mediators (6). In mouse skin, it inhibited tumor-promoting 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (5). In other animal studies, stevia products inhibited hepatic gluconeogenesis (10) and increased insulin sensitivity (11).
Potential effects of stevia on the dopaminergic system and iron metabolism, primary pathways implicated in restless leg syndrome, need further evaluation as there is a case report of a patient with complex comorbidities but no other potential causes for RLS except newly initiated stevia intake (17).",,Sweet herb of Paraguay | Candy leaf | Honey leaf | Sugar leaf,,Stevia,Stevia,

DSI007260,Shiitake Mushroom,C1095912,"Shiitake mushroom, native to East Asia, is cultivated worldwide for its purported health benefits. The fresh and dried forms of the mushroom are commonly used in East Asian cooking. It is also valued as an anticancer agent. Lentinan (1,3 beta-D-glucan), a polysaccharide isolated from shiitake, is thought to be responsible for its beneficial effects. Although it has been shown to have anticancer effects , lentinan is considered a biological response modifier, rather than having a direct cytotoxic effect on tumor cells . Preclinical studies conducted with shiitake extracts revealed immunostimulatory , antiviral , hepatoprotective , antihypercholemic , antiproliferative , cytotoxic , antimutagenic , and anticaries properties. Small randomized studies found shiitake to alter immune function in young adults , a useful adjuvant for preventing dyslipidemia in adults with borderline high cholesterol , and to modulate intestinal microbiota in hypercholesterolemic adults . In patients with advanced gastrointestinal cancer, an orally administered shiitake mycelial extract decreased the incidence of chemotherapy-associated adverse effects ; and in combination with immunotherapy, improved QOL in cancer patients , although a polysaccharide/oligosaccharide complex from a shiitake extract failed to show effectiveness in the treatment of prostate cancer . More well-designed studies are needed to establish shiitake as a useful adjunct to cancer treatment.",,"Supplementation with shiitake mushroom enhanced gut immunity by upregulating interleukin (IL)-23 secretion in a murine model of acute dextran sodium sulfate-colitis (29). Shiitake extracts and the polysaccharide lentinan also exerted antiviral effects, by acting on initial replication processes of poliovirus type 1 (PV-1) and bovine herpes virus type 1 (BoHV-1) (31). Another polysaccharide isolated from shiitake exhibited antibacterial effects in mice by increasing T-helper (Th1) cell immunity, resulting in activation of macrophage-mediated immune response (32). Lentin exhibited antifungal properties, inhibited proliferation of leukemic cells, and suppressed activity of human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) reverse transcriptase (3). Shiitake consumption in adults altered immune function via increased proliferation of gamma delta-T and NK-T cells, increased secretory immunoglobulin A in saliva, increased IL-1alpha, IL-4, IL-10, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α levels, and decreased macrophage inflammatory protein-1alpha/chemokine C-C ligand 3 (MIP-1alpha/CCL3) levels (41). A low-molecular-weight lignin from shiitake inhibited hepatitis C virus by binding to viral apolipoprotein E (apoE) before interacting with cell surface heparan sulfate (38).
Eritadenine from shiitake may exert antihypercholemic effects and regulate lipid metabolism by inhibiting S-adenosyl homocysteine hydrolase activity, and supplementation with both eritadenine and shiitake mushroom upregulated CYP7A1 mRNA expression that was decreased in hypercholesterolemic mice (39). High doses of shiitake mushroom prevented obesity in rats by increasing plasma triacylglycerol accumulation in the liver (30).
Additional studies showed that dried shiitake extract caused apoptosis in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2) cells by mediating caspase-3 and -8 pathways  (21). Inhibition of lung cancer cells by the Latcripin-13 domain isolated from shiitake was shown to be due to apoptotic induction (40). Anticancer effects of the polysaccharide lentinan (1,3 beta-D-glucan) may be due to its ability to suppress cytochrome P450 1A enzymes that are known to metabolize procarcinogens to active forms (2). Polysaccharides SLNT1 and JLNT1 isolated from the mushroom also demonstrated antitumor effects by increasing serum IL-2 levels and TNF-α production, and by inducing apoptosis in tumor cells in mice (33).",Fresh or dried whole mushroom,Forest mushroom | Lentinula | Pasania fungus | Hua gu,,Shiitake Mushroom Protein | Shiitake Mushroom,Shiitake Mushroom,

DSI007385,Sassafras,C0524953,"Sassafras is a perennial tree native to Eastern United States. Native Americans used infusions made from its root bark as a remedy to treat fevers, diarrhea, and rheumatism. It was also used to scent perfume and even as a flavoring for root beer. Studies of sassafras are quite limited and have only been conducted in vitro or in animals. A few experiments suggested antidiabetic and anticancer effects . However, safrole was shown to be a carcinogen , causing it to be banned as a food additive since the 1960s . Based on these data, the FDA continues to classify safrole as a Substance Generally Prohibited From Direct Addition or Use as Human Food .",,"Safrole, the main active constituent, shows cytotoxic effects in human tongue squamous carcinoma SCC-4 cells by apoptosis via the mitochondria- and caspase-dependent signal pathways (7); and through the endoplasmic reticulum stress and intrinsic signaling pathways in human leukemia HL-60 cells (9). It also suppressed myelomonocytic leukemia WEHI-3 cells in vivo, and stimulated macrophage phagocytosis and natural killer cell cytotoxicity in leukemic mice (8).
Toxic effects of safrole in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells were shown to be via induction of an increase in cytosolic free Ca2+ by causing Ca2+ release from the endoplasmic reticulum in a phospholipase C- and protein kinase C-independent fashion, and by inducing Ca2+ influx (16).
However, despite potential apoptotic and cytotoxic effects, data indicates that safrole is “Reasonably anticipated to be a human carcinogen” (5).",,Ague tree | Saxifrax | Cinnamonwood | Saloop | Smelling-stick,,Sassafras,Sassafras,

DSI007456,Transfer Factor,,"Transfer factors are a complex group of more than 200 highly polar, hydrophilic, low molecular weight (<12,000 Da) proteins produced in small quantities by lymphoid cells . They can be extracted from human or animal white blood cells, from cloned lymphocytes, or from colostrum and egg yolk. The parent lymphocyte’s delayed-type hypersensitivity and cell-mediated immunity is passed along to non-immune recipients, and appears to function across species. In animal models, transfer factors were shown to reduce tumor size and increase peripheral blood T-lymphocyte counts . In humans, preliminary studies suggest transfer factors are well tolerated and may have some efficacy for the treatment of herpes , acute infection in children , chronic fatigue syndrome , and candidiasis . One study showed effectiveness in increasing white blood cells, CD8 lymphocytes, and IL-2 levels among patients with HIV . However, transfer factors were reported ineffective in treating hepatitis , multiple sclerosis , extrinsic bronchial asthma , warts , juvenile rheumatoid arthritis , and acne vulgaris . Transfer factors were also ineffective against malignant melanoma , nasopharyngeal carcinoma , bronchogenic carcinoma , Hodgkin’s disease , osteogenic sarcoma , and mycosis fungoides . However, in a study of children with leukemia, immunization with transfer factors conferred protection against varicella-zoster infection . Other preliminary data suggest increased survival rates among patients with early stage lung and cervical cancers . Overall, there is a paucity of large randomized controlled clinical trials, and a need for further research into the effectiveness of transfer factors.",,"Transfer factors contain many molecules, some of which act in an antigen-specific manner, while others appear to have immunomodulating capabilities (1). Human leukocyte dialysates (DLE) contain low molecular peptides that were characterized in the late 1980s as amino terminal ends of enkephalins. A low molecular weight sub fraction derived from DLE, IMREG-1 has been shown to enhance cell-mediated immunity (22).
In vitro, cells of both murine recipients and humans treated for herpes zoster virus infection secrete gamma-interferon in response to transfer factors (2) (23). Studies have also suggested that production of transfer factors but not their immunologic activity is regulated by immune response genes (24).",,"

DSI007517,Tea Tree Oil,C0216194,"Tea tree oil is an essential oil distilled from the leaves of Melaleuca alternifolia, a plant native to Australia. It has been used in traditional medicine for its antiseptic and anti-inflammatory properties to treat various skin conditions and infections. It has also been incorporated into many topical formulations to treat cutaneous infections, speed wound healing, and as an ingredient in skin and hair products. In vitro studies suggest wide-spectrum antimicrobial , antiviral , antiprotozoal , anti-inflammatory and antiproliferative properties. Animal studies also suggest cytotoxic effects . Preliminary studies in humans suggest various topical tea tree oil formulations may help treat acne , athlete’s foot , fungal nail infections , histamine-induced skin inflammation , warts , cold sores , chalazia , and dermatitis . However, additional studies are needed to confirm under what conditions topical applications may be effective.",,"Terpinen-4-ol, a major constituent of tea tree oil, exhibited antimicrobial activity against Candida albicans, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Terpin-4-ol, alpha-terpineol, and alpha-pinene also had antimicrobial effects against Staphylococcus epidermidis and Propionibacterium acnes (2). Terpinen-4-ol suppressed inflammatory mediator production by activating human monocytes (8).
A tea tree oil concentrate prevented influenza virus from entering the host cells by disturbing the normal viral membrane fusion procedure (25). Other in vitro studies indicate that tea tree oil has weak estrogenic and antiandrogenic properties that may alter the estrogen and androgen signaling pathways (13). At the same time, the notion that tea tree oil has hormone-modulating properties has been challenged, and further confirmatory research is needed (27).
Skin irritation following use of tea tree oil is due to its auto-oxidation and formation of epoxide intermediates via arene-epoxidation reactions catalyzed by human cytochrome P450 enzymes (17).",,Tea tree | Melaleuca oil | Australian tea tree oil,,Tea Tree Oil,Tea Tree Oil,

DSI007714,Zeolite,,"Zeolites are a group of chemically related mineral substances that contain mainly hydrated aluminum and silicon compounds. They occur naturally in volcanic rock and ashes and are also formulated synthetically. Zeolites are marketed as dietary supplements for autism, diarrhea, herpes, hangover, to balance body pH, and as a heavy-metal detoxifier, immunomodulator, and antioxidant. Industrial and agricultural applications include their use as additives in gravel, detergents, and animal feed, in water and air purifiers, and in some personal care products. Benefits of using zeolites in animal feed include increased mineral utilization , reduction of heavy metals-induced anemia , and reduction of aflatoxin toxicity . However, none of these benefits are applicable to humans. In addition, this use has raised concerns about accumulated tissue aluminum in treated livestock vis-a-vis the known link of aluminum to several morbidities including Alzheimer’s disease . Generally, the various forms of zeolite are not significantly toxic in acute, short-term oral, or parenteral toxicity studies in animals. However, inhalation toxicity is readily demonstrated , and erionite, a type of airborne fibrous zeolite, has been associated with high incidence of malignant mesothelioma , and geologic occurrences of erionite are emerging as a concern for respiratory illness in the United States. Zeolites have limited use in medicine as an external hemostatic dressing for trauma-related injuries , potential for controlled drug delivery, as a suspending agent, or for use in cardiopulmonary bypass and hemodialysis procedures . A small pilot study sponsored by the manufacturer of a proprietary oral zeolite supplement in immunodeficient patients suggests some immunomodulatory effects , and zeolite formulations reduced symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome and decreased fracture risk in osteoporotic patients . In an Alzheimer’s mouse model, zeolite reduced oxidative damage and plaque generation . Animal studies suggest that micronized zeolite may have anticancer benefits ; and ameliorates malignant mesothelioma caused by asbestos toxicity . Preliminary data suggest benefits of zeolite formulations, used as adjuncts to standard treatment, in reducing symptoms of neuroendocrine tumor-related diarrhea ; and chemo-induced peripheral neuropathy . Special Point: A company filed a U.S. patent application in 2001 for a synthesized form of zeolite as a cancer drug . Data submitted were based on in vitro, plant, and animal studies. The patent specified that the substance must be injected directly into the tumor, which rules out any benefits by oral route.",,"Zeolites are hygroscopic compounds with a fine porous cage-like structure that allows for its ion-exchanging, adsorbent, anticaking, chelating, and desiccant characteristics (22) (23). Its ion-exchanging properties may alter the ionic composition, pH and buffering capacity of the gastrointestinal tract under conditions of overexposure (22).
Zeolite controls bleeding by absorbing water from the hemorrhage site through an exothermic reaction which supports the concentration of coagulation factors and platelets, causing clot formation (12). Zeolite pH buffering effects also adsorb nitrosamines in acidic solution (24), leading to unsubstantiated claims that it could remove carcinogenic substances in the stomach.
In vitro studies indicate that micronized zeolite inhibits protein kinase B, induces expression of tumor suppressor proteins (19), and limits reactive oxygen species effects (15). In animal studies, it reduced metastasis and increased the effect of doxorubicin due to its antioxidant properties (18). Zeolites may also have both immunosuppressive and immunostimulating effects, causing a decline of GM-CFU in the bone marrow (25), but also increasing graft-versus-host (GvH) reaction (26). Zeolite can affect brain serotonergic receptor activities of mammary carcinoma-bearing mice (27), but the clinical implications for humans is unclear. Zeolite supplementation did not prolong survival in tumor-bearing animals (25).",,Clinoptilolite | Erionite | Phillipsite | Mordenite,,Zeolite,Zeolite,

The pulp and skin of acai fruit are rich in anthocyanins, proanthocyanidins, and fatty acids . It is marketed as a dietary supplement to lower cholesterol, support heart health, and for its antioxidant properties.Preclinical experiments suggest acai has anti-inflammatory , antioxidant , proapoptotic , antitumorigenic , atheroprotective , and anticancer effects. An acai extract inhibited beta-amyloid inhibition, which suggests it may also have neuroprotective activity . In a murine model, nasal administration of acai polysaccharides potentiated innate immunity against pulmonary infections . Other animal studies suggest oral acai extract may help prevent exercise intolerance, cardiac hypertrophy, and dysfunction in rats with myocardial infarction .Limited clinical studies suggest improvements in biomarkers of inflammation and oxidative stress in individuals with metabolic syndrome , tinnitus and vascular function in overweight adults . Other preliminary data suggest an acai juice product may lengthen prostate specific antigen PSA doubling time in patients with recurrent prostate cancer . However, these observations need confirmation in larger well-designed studies .Acai protected against chemo-induced cardiotoxicity in murine models . But because of its antioxidant effects, acai may interfere with the actions of certain chemotherapy drugs. Consumption of contaminated acai fruit with insects carrying Trypanosoma cruzii, a protozoan that causes Chagas disease, resulted in 178 cases of acute disease .",,"Antioxidant properties of acai (5) (6) have been related to scavenging reactive oxygen species (7). It also protected human vascular endothelial cells against oxidative stress and inflammation, downregulated IL-6 and -8 expression at mRNA and protein levels, and inhibited gene expression of adhesion molecules and NF-κB activation (14). Anti-inflammatory effects may occur via NO or COX inhibition (5) (8). In a diabetic murine model, an acai seed extract protected against hepatic steatosis by reducing hepatic lipogenesis and increasing antioxidant defense and cholesterol excretion (25).Apoptosis in HL-60 leukemia cells with acai may occur through caspase 3 activation (2). Cytotoxic effects on various malignant cell lines were attributed to increased expression of LC3BII, a protein marker of auto-phagosome formation (18).",,Acai berry | Acai palm | Cabbage palm | Palm berry,,,Acai Berry,
DSI007807,Agaricus,None,"Agaricus blazei is an edible mushroom native to Brazil and is cultivated in Japan for medicinal uses. It has been used to treat arteriosclerosis, hepatitis, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, dermatitis, and cancer. Preclinical studies suggest antidiabetic , antiangiogenic, apoptotic, and antiproliferative effects . Studies in humans are limited. A few suggest that agaricus extracts improved insulin resistance in diabetic patients , reduced weight, body fat, glucose, and cholesterol levels in healthy individuals , and improved quality of life in patients with ulcerative colitis . An oral agaricus extract improved natural killer cell activity and quality of life in gynecological cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy . Other preliminary data show that daily intake of agaricus powder improves quality of life among cancer patients in remission . Although no survival improvements were reported with an agaricus extract in multiple myeloma patients, immunomodulatory effects were observed . However, agaricus extract did not confer any benefits in elderly women . Larger studies are needed to resolve the ambiguity. Whereas a small study reported that agaricus extract may improve liver function in patients with hepatitis B , liver damage and deaths along with cheilitis have been reported following consumption. In addition, laboratory samples of agaricus had high levels of inorganic arsenic . Brefeldin A, a compound isolated from agaricus, was shown to have estrogenic activity, but did not stimulate growth of breast cancer cells .",,"Agaricus extract was shown to exert estrogen-like activity and may help prevent atherosclerosis via dual roles in cell signaling, macrophage development suppression and endothelial cell recovery from vascular damage (16). Both aqueous and organic extracts of agaricus offered protection to cells exposed to methyl methanesulphonate, a mutagenic agent. The stimulus produced by linoleic acid on beta-DNA polymerase, an enzyme involved in repair mechanism following exposure of DNA to alkylating agents, is thought responsible for such an effect (19).
Ergosterol, a major constituent of agaricus, was found to inhibit tumor growth in mice via direct inhibition of tumor-induced angiogenesis (6). Other studies demonstrated that polysaccharides present in agaricus extract caused activation of macrophages (5) or natural killer cells (17) and induced cytotoxic T-lymphocyte activity in tumor-bearing mice. Specifically, activation of natural killer cells was mediated through IL-12-induced IFN-gamma expression (18). Agaricus extract stimulates caspase 3 activation and reduces telomerase activity (19) possibly through regulation of Akt signaling (20) thereby inducing apoptosis in cancer cell lines. Blazeispirol A, produced by agaricus fermentation, causes both caspase-dependent and -independent cell death in human Hep 3B cells (21). Agaritine, a hydrazine-containing constituent also exhibits antitumor activity toward U937 leukemic cells mediated through apoptosis (22). In another study, polysaccharides isolated from agaricus were shown to induce apoptosis in HL-60 cells through a signaling cascade of mitochondrial caspase-3-dependent pathway (28).","Agaricus is an edible fungus.

DSI007808,Aloe Vera,C0995182,"Aloe vera is a perennial, succulent plant that resembles a cactus and is used in traditional medicine throughout the world. The clear thick gel obtained from aloe leaves is used for wound healing, to treat burns, psoriasis, frostbite, ulcerative colitis, diabetes and to relieve constipation. Aloe demonstrated antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties in vitro . In clinical studies, topical aloe was superior to silver sulfadiazine creams for second-degree burns , equally effective as an estrogen cream against vaginal atrophy in menopausal women , useful for skin graft donor-site healing and improving symptoms of acute radiation proctitis in patients receiving radiotherapy as well as postoperative pain and discomfort following pilonidal sinus excision . Aloe vera mouthwash reduced plaque and gingivitis with the effects comparable to chlorhexidine . Systematic reviews also determined benefits of aloe vera against oral ulcers , oral submucous fibrosis and oral lichen planus . In addition, aloe gel complex reduced body weight and insulin resistance in obese individuals with pre-diabetes or early untreated diabetes mellitus , prevented pressure ulcers in hospitalized orthopedic patients at risk of developing such ulcers and traumatic oral ulceration in patients with fixed orthodontic appliances , along with accelerating split-thickness skin graft donor-site healing . Adjuvant use of aloe may improve quality of life in patients with systolic heart failure .Constituents of aloe, such as acemannan, emodin, aloeride,and di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (DEHP) also have immunomodulating and anticancer effects . Preliminary findings suggest benefits of aloe in preventing chemo-induced oral mucositis in adults and pediatric patients. It may also help improve tumor regression rate and survival in those with metastatic cancers . However, studies of topical aloe for radiation-induced skin damage produced mixed results .",,"Several studies have been conducted to explore the mechanisms of action of aloe.
Oligosaccharides isolated from aloe extracts were found to prevent ultraviolet radiation-induced suppression of delayed type hypersensitivity by reducing keratinocyte-derived immunosuppressive cytokines (25). Proposed mechanism underlying anti-psoriatic effect includes inhibition of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)‑alpha‑induced proliferation of keratinocytes and overactivation of the nuclear factor (NF‑kappa B signaling pathway, by an aloe polysaccharide (40). And a polymer fraction of aloe was shown to protect the gastric mucosa against ethanol-induced gastric damage by decreasing mRNA expression levels of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS), and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP-9). The three enzymes are critical biomarkers in gastric ulceration (26). Other findings suggest that the radio-protective effects of aloe polysaccharides are most likely due to inhibition of apoptosis (27).
Emodin, an extract of Aloe vera, was shown to inhibit cell proliferation and induce apoptosis in human liver cancer cell lines through p53- and p21-dependent pathways (4). Acemannan, a carbohydrate fraction derived from Aloe vera leaf, was found to stimulate cytokine production in mouse macrophage cell line (5). It also exhibited immunomodulating activity by inducing maturation of dendritic cells (6). And aloeride, a polysaccharide obtained from aloe vera juice, was reported to be a potent immunostimulator that acts by enhancing NF-kappa B activities (7). In addition, di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (DEHP), isolated from Aloe vera, inhibited leukemic cells, in vitro (8).",,Aloe gel | aloe leaf,,,Aloe Vera,
DSI007809,Antineoplastons,None,"Antineoplastons refer to mixtures of peptides, amino acids, and other organic substances that were first isolated from human urine and blood by Stanislaw Burzynski. He claims to have used antineoplastons to treat a variety of cancers based on the belief that they promote the body’s natural defenses against cancer. In 1993, the National Cancer Institute sponsored clinical trials to investigate the antitumor potential of antineoplastons in patients with brain tumors . The trials were closed 2 years later as poor patient accrual precluded conclusions about treatment efficacy. In addition, a Mayo clinic study found no benefit . Antineoplastons have also been tested in patients with gliomas , but lack of a rigid scientific approach in these studies has been questioned . A preliminary study of antineoplastons adjunctive to hepatic arterial infusion post-hepatectomy did not improve overall survival, although cancer-specific survival was higher . The status of other clinical trials using antineoplastons as investigational drugs for various cancers remains unknown . Adverse reactions observed include confusion, sleepiness, and exacerbation of underlying seizures, headache, vomiting, fatigue, stomach fullness, and phlebitis.",,"Proposed mechanisms for the anticancer activity of antineoplastons include activation of the tumor suppressor gene p53 by phenylacetate and AS2-1, metabolites of A10 (3-phenyl-acetylamino-2, 6-peperidinedione) (2). Phenylacetylglutamine, the main component of A10-I, may inhibit uptake of amino acids that are essential for cancer cell growth (2). A10 inhibited neutrophil apoptosis in breast cancer cells. Since depletion of neutrophils is associated with development of cancer, researchers suggest a role for A10 as an adjuvant therapy for breast cancer (3).",,Antineoplaston treatment,,,Antineoplastons,

It is promoted to help both female sexual dysfunction and erectile dysfunction in men. Sexual dysfunction may involve loss of sexual desire, difficulty maintaining arousal, painful intercourse, or difficulty achieving orgasm. It can result from factors such as stress, hormonal imbalances, cancer treatment, antidepressant use, or menopause. ArginMax is thought to enhance blood circulation and muscle relaxation resulting in increased sexual satisfaction. Pilot studies suggest improvements in women with sexual dysfunction and men with erectile dysfunction , but a study in female cancer survivors did not see such benefit although improved quality of life was reported . ArginMax contains ginseng, which may have estrogenic effects although data are conflicting . L-arginine may worsen symptoms in people with allergen-induced asthma and reduce blood pressure . It may also affect blood sugar levels and should be used with caution in patients with diabetes.",,"The main ingredient in ArginMax is L-arginine, an essential amino acid and a precursor to nitric oxide that may modulate vaginal blood supply and smooth muscle relaxation (3). Ginsenosides present in ginseng have been shown to increase nitric oxide production (4). Gingko is believed to facilitate microvascular circulation (5).

Sexual dysfunction may involve loss of sexual desire, difficulty in maintaining arousal, painful intercourse, or difficulty in achieving orgasm. It may result from factors such as stress, hormonal imbalances, cancer treatment involving surgery, radiation, chemotherapy or hormone therapy, use of antidepressants, or menopause. Avlimil is thought to enhance sexual satisfaction by increasing blood flow and by promoting muscle relaxation. Some of the components may improve circulation. Results from in vitro and in vivo assays suggest Avlimil has both estrogenic and antiestrogenic effects, at low and high concentrations respectively . A small unpublished clinical trial involving 49 women found Avlimil to have a positive effect on sexual response . However, ingredients in the commercial product are different from those used in the study . Avlimil has not been studied in cancer patients.

DSI007812,Ayurveda,None,"Derived from the Sanskrit words “ayur” (life) and “veda” (knowledge), Ayurveda originated in India over 3,000 years ago. Treatment is patient-tailored and consists of oral formulations containing herbal, mineral, spice, and animal components, purgatives, dietary and lifestyle changes, and improving mental balance through yoga or meditation. It is available in a few clinics in North America, but there is no licensure for practicing Ayurveda in the United States. Ayurvedic medicinals, which can contain from a few to hundreds of components, are commonly used to treat chronic diseases such as diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, Parkinson’s disease, acne, obesity, and cancer. Studies in humans are quite limited, perhaps in part due to the individualized nature of Ayurveda treatment. Preliminary data suggest some benefit of various Ayurvedic formulations for diabetes . In an equivalence study, pain reductions and improved function with either of two traditional ayurvedic formulations were comparable to glucosamine and celecoxib for knee osteoarthritis . However, additional safety studies are needed. Other preliminary data suggest that an individualized Ayurvedic treatment may be as effective as methotrexate against rheumatoid arthritis . A clinical trial of guggulipid for hyperlipidemia found it may actually raise cholesterol levels . A few Ayurvedic herbs are being investigated for their anticancer potential. Curcumin is among the most extensively studied, but positive findings are preliminary. Lifestyle changes and mind-body modalities are also a core component of Ayurveda. Yoga has been shown to improve sleep, mood, and quality of life, and reduce stress in cancer patients both during treatment and throughout survivorship. The effects of meditation in reducing anxiety, lowering blood pressure, and enhancing well-being both in the general population and in oncology settings have also been confirmed.",,"Ayurveda emphasizes both health maintenance (Svasthavritha), and diagnosis and treatment (Athuravritha). Patients are classified by their prominent dosha, or physical, emotional, and metabolic type, Kapha, Pitta, or Vata, each located in specific organs and associated with two of the five elements (earth, fire, water, air, and ether) and five senses. The doshas represent properties shared by the organs, body, environment, and cosmos. When a patient’s unique state of dosha is out of balance, illness occurs. Therapy is personalized to the individual’s problems and metabolic characteristics to restore balance through diet and lifestyle modifications, medicinals (herbs, spices, metals and/or animal products), breathing exercises, and meditation. Detoxification (panchakarma) occurs before administration of medicines, which includes bloodletting, induced vomiting, and bowel purging. The therapeutic approach seeks to cure disease by reversing the steps that led to it (eg, administering cooling medicines if Pitta, the hot dosha, is predominant) (10).
Maharasnadi Quathar, a medicinal used to treat rheumatoid arthritis, increases antioxidant enzyme activity, decreases TBARS generation, and improves symptoms in human subjects (16). Many of the frequently used herbs, such as ashwagandha (Withania somnifera), guggul (Commiphora mukul), Boswellia (Boswellia serrata), gotu kola (Centella asiatica), curcumin (Curcuma longa), ginger (Zingiber officinale), aloe (Aloe barbadensis), and garlic (Allium sativum), have been studied extensively in vitro and in vivo, and show antioxidant, antitumor, antimicrobial, immunomodulatory, or anti-inflammatory properties. Herbs often used to treat diabetes, Gymnema sylvestre, Momordica charantia, fenugreek (Trigonella foenum-graecum), Coccinia indica, and Pterocarpus marsupium, show hypoglycemic activity in vitro and in vivo. Mucuna pruriens, used in preparations for Parkinson’s disease, contains L-dopa (17). Rasayana herbs, such as ashwagandha, Asparagus racemosus, Emblica officinalis, Piper longum, and Terminalia chebula that are said to promote positive health showed immunostimulant and adaptogenic activities in an animal study (18). Ayurvedic gold preparations (eg, Swarna Bhasma) have antioxidant and restorative effects in animal models of ischemia (19). The herbal mixtures Maharishi Amrit Kalash-4 and -5 have antioxidant properties, inhibit LDL oxidation in vitro, inhibit platelet aggregation, and cause a reduction in aortic arch atheroma in hyperlipidemic rabbits (20).
An in vitro study investigated the activity of extracts from eight plants that are traditionally used as immunomodulators in Ayurvedic medicine against HIV: Allium sativum, Asparagus racemosus, Coleus forskohlii, Emblica officinalis, Glycyrrhiza glabra, Piper longum, Tinospora cordifolia and Withania somnifera (21).

It also enhanced the activity of cisplatin against prostate cancer cells . The parenteral form of beta-elemene isolated from Rhizoma zedoariae, a species of ginger, has been studied in Asia and is reported to relieve pain, decrease the side effects of chemotherapy, and increase the quality of life in cancer patients.

However, controlled trials are needed to confirm this observation.",,"In an erythroleukemic cell line, beta-elemene inhibited telomerase activity, which was enhanced in combination with cyclophosphamide (9). It also demonstrated anti-fibrotic effects, inducing decreases in plasma angiotensin II levels and angiotensin II receptor type 1 expression, reducing collagen formation in a liver fibrosis rat model (10). Beta-elemene also exhibits anti-inflammatory effects, with reduction in LPS-induced nitric oxide production and prostaglandin E2 by rat peritoneal macrophages (11).Beta-elemene has been shown to affect cancer cells via different mechanisms. In an in vitro study, following administration of beta-elemene, leukemia cells were arrested in S/G2 phase and underwent apoptosis (2). The antiproliferative effects were dependent on p38 MAPK activation/phosphorylation, cell cycle arrest in G0/G1, and inhibition of tumor growth of glioblastoma cells (3). Beta-elemene also induced G2/M arrest in lung carcinoma cells and ovarian cancer cells by combined reduction of cell-cycle promoters Cdc2 and cyclin B1, and elevated cell cycle regulators p53 and p27 (4) (5). Derivatives of beta-elemene showed antiproliferative activity in human cervical carcinoma cells through a decrease in cell cycle protein Cyclin D1 and thus cell cycle suppression (14). Furthermore, beta-elemene may enhance the effects of chemotherapy and radiation. In non-small cell lung cancer cells, apoptosis was induced by increased expression of Bax and p-Bcl-2, decreased Bcl-2 and XIAP, and augmented cisplatin-induced increases in caspase activity (6). In another study, apoptosis response to the taxanes paclitaxel and docetaxel in lung carcinoma cells was enhanced with beta-elemene, through increases in cytochrome c, caspase activity, downregulation of Bcl-2, and altered cell membrane permeability (7). Beta-elemene combined with radiation induced apoptosis in lung adenocarcinoma cells, possibly by sensitizing cancer cells to radiation (8).An in vivo study showed that beta-elemene inhibits growth of lung cancer cells, and up-regulates the expression of the tumor suppressor, P53, and the release of exosome (22). Another proposed mechanism is that beta-elemene reverses the resistance of lung cancer cells to cisplatin via the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway (23).",Rhizoma zedoariae (E Zhu)Curcuma aromatica (Wenyujin),"

DSI007814,BioResonance Therapy,None,"Bioresonance therapy, available in clinics in Europe, Mexico, Florida, and elsewhere in the US, is used to diagnose and treat cancer, allergies, arthritis, and chronic degenerative diseases. A variation known as electrodermal testing was developed as an aid in prescribing homeopathic remedies, and is used in Europe for the diagnosis of allergies. Bioresonance therapy is based on the claim that electromagnetic oscillations emitted by diseased organs and cancer cells vary from those emitted by healthy cells due to their differences in cell metabolism and DNA damage. No evidence supports these claims. Treatment may involve removal and replacement of dental alloys or amalgams, which are said to carry currents that “alter the body’s electromagnetic circulatory system.” Clinical trials evaluating electrodermal testing show no reliability in diagnosing allergies . A randomized trial of bioresonance for the treatment of atopic dermatitis in children showed no efficacy . In addition, European guidelines do not recommend bioresonance for atopic dermatitis . The Food and Drug Administration has prosecuted numerous purveyors of electrical devices for making unsubstantiated health benefit claims . The American Cancer Society advises patients not to seek treatment with unproved electronic devices .",,"Bioresonance is based upon the unproved premise that electromagnetic oscillations emitted by damaged organs and cancer cells vary from those emitted by healthy cells due to their differences in cell metabolism and DNA damage. An electrical device supposedly detects these differences and can determine which organs are affected and “cancel out” their diseased signal via destructive wave interference (1) (2).
Electrodermal testing was developed as an aid in prescribing homeopathic remedies. Medicines are tested “to determine how well they resonate with the individual or how similar they are to the body frequencies needing enhancement to overcome an illness.” Practitioners claim the wave emission from homeopathic medicines or allergens is measured through the device and is modulated through the patient’s autonomic nervous system, influencing skin resistance (4) (6). No evidence supports any of these claims.
Some proponents claim the device naturally kills tumor cells by releasing “suppressed” tumor suppressor genes or attenuating overactive oncogenes. This hypothesis is untenable because of the irreversibility of most cancer-causing genetic mutations. An evaluation of one device found that a galvanic skin response of low resistance was not a reliable indicator of vertebral pathology, and that the device produced a low-resistance reading after 5 seconds of application to any point on the body (7) (8).",,Electrodermal testing | Bio-physical information therapy | BIT; Bio-energetic therapy; Energy medicine | Vibrational medicine,,,BioResonance Therapy,

It is used in traditional medicine to treat hypothyroidism due to iodine deficiency. It is also promoted as a dietary supplement for weight loss. In preclinical studies, bladder wrack extracts demonstrated anticollagenase, antioxidant, and chemopreventive properties . Data in humans are limited and suggest only marginal impacts on metabolic and inflammatory responses and no more effectiveness than placebo for osteoarthritic symptoms .

In rats, bladder wrack lengthened overall estrous cycles and reduced circulating 17,beta-estradiol levels (4).
Bladder wrack and related seaweed species exhibit antihypertensive effects via angiotensin-I-converting enzyme inhibition. Antibacterial and antioxidant properties may be due to polyphenols (1). Topical bladder wrack reduced skin thickness and improved the mechanical/elastic properties (2).

DSI007817,Diet,C3668949,"Developed by Dr. Johanna Budwig in the 1950s, the Budwig diet is an unproven cancer treatment involving consumption of multiple daily servings of flaxseed oil and cottage cheese as well as vegetables, fruits, and juices. It prohibits intake of sugar, animal fats, shellfish, processed foods, soy, and most dairy products. It also encourages daily sunbathing and is often combined with coffee enemas. Budwig believed that cancer was caused by the lack of polyunsaturated fatty acids, and that a combination of flax oil and cottage cheese would improve cellular function. Although she wrote books and papers to provide anecdotal evidence and biochemical mechanisms of the diet, clinical trials have not been published in any peer-reviewed medical journal. Polyunsaturated fatty acids such as omega-3 found in flaxseeds have been shown to exert anticancer activities , but there is no evidence that such a diet has any benefit in preventing or treating cancer in humans. Whereas a balanced diet consisting of vegetables and fruits can be beneficial for general health, restricted diets may increase risk of nutritional deficiencies . High levels of sun exposure can result in increased risk of sunburn and skin cancer . | The Mediterranean diet is consumed in regions that border the Mediterranean Sea. Epidemiological studies show that it contributes to better health and overall quality of life. It is also an established model of eating for primary and secondary prevention of various chronic diseases. The Mediterranean diet consists of a variety of fruits, vegetables, cereals, legumes, poultry, fish, nuts, seeds, olive oil, and moderate intake of red wine with meals . Olive oil, a monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA), comprises 15% to 20% as the major source of dietary fats in this diet . Another hallmark is the low consumption of meat and dairy products . The Mediterranean lifestyle also emphasizes social connection by sharing meals with family and friends. Epidemiological analyses suggest that over 90% of type 2 diabetes, 80% of coronary heart disease, and 70% of stroke can be avoided by adopting healthful food choices that model the traditional Mediterranean diet . In addition, large prospective studies have found the Mediterranean diet reduces hip fracture incidence , risk of cardiovascular events and gastrointestinal cancers , overall cancer risk , and preserves kidney function in coronary heart disease patients . When compared to a specific carbohydrate diet, Mediterranean diet may also confer greater benefit in patients with Crohn’s disease with mild to moderate symptoms . Other studies suggest it can reduce systolic blood pressure, improve endothelial functioning , and protect against macular degeneration . As well, leisure-time physical activity along with the Mediterranean diet, both individually and when combined, lowered all-cause mortality in older adults . Adherence to Mediterranean diet, physical activity, smoking abstinence, sedentary behavior avoidance also lowered all-cause mortality in adults regardless of age or medication burden . Various meta-analyses have also confirmed that Mediterranean diet reduces the risk of diabetes and cardiovascular diseases , overall mortality , and cancer as well as incidence of Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease . Taken together, data on the Mediterranean diet further underscores the importance of emphasizing fruits vegetables, legumes, healthy fats, and whole grains. Cancer patients may have special nutritional needs and should consult a dietician before changing diet. Alcohol consumption can increase the risk of certain cancers . Interestingly, certain factors that improved adherence to the Mediterranean diet included female sex, older age, and higher levels of physical activity, while poorer adherence was associated with males and obesity .",,"Dr. Budwig developed the diet based on the hypothesis that cancer is caused by reduced uptake of oxygen by cell membranes in the absence of omega-3 fatty acids (O3FAs) such as linolenic acid (7). While metabolic changes such as increased aerobic glycolysis and fatty acid synthesis occur in cancerous cells, (8) the role of O3FAs in the pathogenesis or cancer treatment is still under investigation (2). Polyunsaturated O3FAs in flaxseed oil have been shown to decrease levels of proinflammatory cytokines, TNF-alpha, and IL-1 beta (9). O3FAs also demonstrated antineoplastic properties by increasing intracellular ROS and decreasing protumorigenic prostaglandins (2). Flax oil supplements increased total phospholipid fatty acid content in erythrocytes  (10), but the implication of this finding in cancer treatment is unknown. Flaxseed supplements also inhibited in vitro proliferation of human prostate (11) and breast cancer growth by downregulating growth factors and increasing p53 expression (12). Whole flaxseed contains lignans, phytoestrogens that may also have antineoplastic properties and exert hormonal effects (13).
Budwig believed that combining cottage cheese and flaxseed oil improved availability of essential fatty acids through the plasma membrane, thereby improving aerobic cellular respiration (1). The effect of cottage cheese consumption on the bioavailability of O3FAs has not been studied. Processed fats, saturated fats, animal fats, processed foods, and sugar are prohibited in the Budwig diet because they are thought to interfere with oxygen uptake and cellular respiration. Epidemiological studies show that people who consume lactovegetarian diets have lower incidence of gastrointestinal cancer compared with non-vegetarians (14) (15), although these studies indicate association rather than causation.
Greater tumor regression was reported in mice treated with trastuzumab therapy plus flax oil compared with those treated with trastuzumab alone (16). | The health benefits of the diet are attributed to the synergistic interactions across nutrients, and not to a single nutrient (1). At the same time, specific activities have been identified to partly explain the cardioprotective and anti-inflammatory effects, including decreases in oxidative stress, inflammation, plasma N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) concentrations, and tumor necrosis factor α (24) (25) . Greater polyphenol intake from lignans, flavonols, and hydroxybenzoic acids found in the Mediterranean diet may be associated with decreased cardiovascular disease risks (26). Extra virgin olive oil, which contains phenolic compounds, vitamin E, and other lipid molecules, also has antiatherogenic effects, improving endothelial function, lipid profiles, insulin sensitivity, glycemic control, and blood pressure levels (17) (27) (28).","Organic flaxseed combined with low-fat cottage cheese | A variety of fruits, vegetables, cereals, legumes, combined with poultry, fish, nuts, seeds, olive oil and moderate red wine intake with meals (1).","Budwig protocol | Flaxseed oil diet | Linseed oil diet | Flax oil and cottage cheese diet | Oil-protein diet | Cellect-Budwig protocol | Bill Henderson protocol |

DSI007818,CAAT,None,"Controlled Amino Acid Therapy (CAAT) was developed by Angelo John of the A. P. John Institute for Cancer Research. It is a protocol that involves amino acid and carbohydrate deprivation. The objective of this therapy is to impair the development of cancer cells by altering cell formation through structure, energy, blood vessels, growth hormones and function. The regimen consists of a diet that restricts intake of carbohydrates and proteins, and involves the use of supplements. In addition, supplementation with Superoxide Dismutase, curcumin, parsley, quercetin, lycopene, Vitamin D and green tea extract is encouraged. (See individual monographs for more information about those supplements.) The protocol is meant to be maintained for six to nine months as an adjunct to conventional chemotherapy and radiation. Whereas the Institute’s now defunct website described studies that support the theories behind the protocol, no studies have been conducted to determine the safety or efficacy of the regimen itself.",,"According to its proponents, CAAT curbs the growth of cancer cells by impairing a number of factors essential to their growth. Restricting a cancer cell’s access to glycine is thought to limit its ability to replicate its DNA, build new blood vessels, and create growth factors and other hormones essential for metastatic growth. Additionally, the low-carbohydrate diet is thought to inhibit glycolysis, the main mechanism for cancer cells to derive energy.",,Controlled Amino Acid Therapy,,,CAAT,
DSI007819,Calcium Glucarate,C0006698,"Calcium glucarate is the salt and commercial form of glucaric acid, which occurs naturally in a variety of foods including apples, oranges, broccoli, and spinach . Calcium glucarate and other derivatives have been used to prevent and treat cancer. Patients with breast cancer sometimes self-medicate with calcium glucarate supplements following surgery or adjunctive treatments. The glucarate component, not the calcium, is thought to account for its activity. Following administration, glucarate is converted to D-glucaro-1,4-lactone, which inhibits beta-glucuronidase . In vitro and animal studies suggest inhibition of beta-glucuronidase may prevent carcinogenesis , as well as initiation and promotion of cancer cells . Increased elimination of carcinogens and hormones including estrogen has also been shown . In colon and lung cancer models, calcium glucarate exerted chemopreventive effects in the post-initiation phase of carcinogenesis. Dietary calcium glucarate also inhibited oral carcinogenesis . Topical calcium glucarate suppressed tumor development in murine skin tumors , and enhanced chemopreventive effects were achieved with a topical butyric acid, nicotinamide, and calcium glucarate combination . Other preclinical data suggest topical ursolic acid along with dietary calcium glucarate supplementation could also reduce skin tumor promotion and inflammatory signaling . Preliminary findings from a human study suggest that low glucaric acid levels and/or high beta-glucuronidase levels are markers of detoxification system impairment, and that calcium glucarate supplementation might reduce the cancer risk of some individuals . Subsequent studies have not materialized and are needed to confirm such effects.",,"The glucarate component, not the calcium, accounts for the activity of calcium glucarate, which is absorbed from the gut as D-glucaric acid. This is further converted to D-glucaro-1,4-lactone, which is thought to inhibit beta-glucuronidase activity (4). Beta-glucuronidase has been shown to decrease the rate of elimination of estrogen and carcinogens such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and nitrosamines by deconjugation (3). Inhibition of beta-glucuronidase activity with calcium glucarate improves excretion of metabolized estrogen and carcinogens (2). D-glucarate can also be metabolized by gut bacteria, inhibit bacterial beta-glucuronidase, and potentially alter the enterohepatic cycle.
In animal studies, calcium glucarate reduced the quantity of benzo[a]pyrene-induced lung lesions with mutated K-ras and p53 genes in the post-initiation phase via DNA adduct removal, mutagenic suppression, and anti-inflammatory activity (8). Antitumorigenic effects of topical calcium glucarate may be due to stimulated differentiation via induction of transglutaminase activity and suppression of proliferation (6), as well as inhibition of thymidine kinase and aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase activities, thus preventing carcinogen-DNA binding (10). Enhanced chemopreventive effects by a topical butyric acid, nicotinamide, and calcium glucarate combination used on murine skin tumors occurred via induced mitochondria-mediated apoptosis, upregulated p21, and downregulated Bcl-2, mut p53 (12). In another study this combination regulated miR-203 status through epigenetic or biogenetic modulations before and after tumor development to a greater degree than each of the individual compounds (13). Reduced epidermal hyperplasia with a combination of topical ursolic acid and dietary calcium glucarate supplementation caused a marked decrease in COX-2 and IL-6 expression (14).

This treatment was very popular in Italy in the late 1990s as Di Bella claimed he cured thousands on an outpatient basis and physicians in other countries such as Canada also prescribed it. The treatment was also highly publicized and politicized in Italy, raising the issue of “freedom of treatment” for patients who could not afford the expensive regimen. In response, local judges ordered that somatostatin be added to the list of effective reimbursable medications , and the Italian National Institute of Health supported 11 separate open-label uncontrolled phase II studies of 8 different cancers, organized by Di Bella and the National Cancer Advisory Committee . These trials found no complete responses , 0.8% partial response rate, and considerable toxicity . However, in uncontrolled studies 20 patients with late stage non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma had a 70% response rate , and 15 patients with osteosarcoma had improved survival and quality of life with similar regimens. Adverse effects include increased pain at tumor site, nausea, vomiting, anorexia, diarrhea, and somnolence . Somatostatin may reduce or eliminate the efficacy of painkillers such as methadone and morphine .",,"The Di Bella Multitherapy is based on the theory that growth hormone (GH) and prolactin are involved in neoplastic growth, particularly in lymphomas and leukemias. The following components have been studied, but their combined activities and at the Di Bella doses are unknown.
Somatostatin inhibits growth hormone (GH) secretion. Its synthetic analog, octreotide, shows antineoplastic activity in vitro and in vivo, and is used clinically for the treatment of acromegaly and neuroendocrine tumors. Their biological effects are mediated via high affinity plasma membrane receptors that are found throughout the body and on many human tumors. Clinical studies show a reduction in serum IGF-1 and IGF-1 gene expression after treatment with octreotide (1). Somatostatin and analogs also enhance secretion and expression of IGF-binding protein-1, which negatively regulates plasma IGF-1, while inhibiting mitogens and secretion of gastrointestinal hormones implicated in tumor growth. Somatostatin analogs also show immune-modulating activity in vitro and inhibit angiogenesis and directly induce cell growth arrest and apoptosis in vivo and in vitro (7).Melatonin is a free-radical scavenger and displays anti-proliferative effects on various cancer cell lines in vitro, but no human studies show evidence of anti-tumor activity. Melatonin shows antimyelodysplastic activity and reduces bone marrow toxicity of chemotherapeutic agents in animal models. See melatonin for additional information (2) (3) (4) (5).Bromocriptine is a dopamine agonist and prolactin inhibitor. Prolactin stimulates growth of lymphomas in vivo and in vitro, and prolactin receptors are present on normal and neoplastic lymphoid cells.
Retinoids act as antioxidants and immunostimulants, cause cell growth arrest in B-cell lymphomas in vitro, and have shown benefit in trials of promyelotic leukemia and cutaneous T-cell lymphoma.
ACTH receptors can be found on T and B lymphocytes and ACTH has been seen to depress lymphocyte blastogenesis and modulate NK cell activity in vitro (6).",,Di Bella's tetralogy | DBM | Di Bella regimen,,,Di Bella Multitherapy,
DSI007829,Essiac,C0673827,"Essiac was developed in the 1920s by Rene Caisse, a Canadian nurse, and promoted as an alternative cancer treatment. It is a formulation of four botanicals: burdock root, sheep sorrel, slippery elm bark, and rhubarb root . Essiac demonstrated antioxidant and cytotoxic properties in vitro , but stimulated growth of human breast cancer cells both via estrogen receptor (ER)-dependent and ER-independent pathways . Studies of its antiproliferative effects on prostate cancer cells also yielded conflicting data . Remission of hormone-refractory prostate cancer was reported in a patient , but a retrospective study of breast cancer patients found that Essiac did not improve quality of life or mood . Despite unsubstantiated claims , Essiac remains a popular anticancer therapy.",,"Rhubarb and sheep sorrel contain anthraquinones that stimulate secretion of mucosa and water, as well as peristalsis. In vitro and animal models suggest anthraquinones isolated from rhubarb may stimulate IL-1, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor. Burdock root induced hypoglycemia in animal models. The tannin extract may induce macrophage response and lignan and sesquiterpene extracts inhibited platelet activating factor in vitro (1) (2).

DSI007830,GCP,None,"A nutritional supplement prepared by fermenting soy extract with medicinal mushrooms, genistein combined polysaccharide (GCP) is composed of genistein, a soy isoflavone; and polysaccharides obtained from mushrooms. Studies have shown that isoflavones influence hormone-dependent cancers due to their estrogenic activity. Basidiomycetes, which include mushrooms, express immune-stimulant and antitumor activity.GCP was found to reduce androgen receptor and prostate specific antigen (PSA) levels, induce cell growth arrest, and modestly increase apoptosis in prostate cancer cells, . It also inhibited cell growth along with inducing apoptosis in androgen-dependent and -independent human prostate cancer cell lines ; as well as potentiated the cytostatic and cytotoxic activities of docetaxel, bicalutamide, and the sRC kinase inhibitor, pp2 . Another study found that GCP treatment resulted in significant inhibition of cell proliferation and arrested the cell cycle in the G2/M phase in three human lymphoid cell lines .Case reports show complete regression of T3 prostate cancer following treatment with GCP ; and supplementation with GCP prevented recurrence of transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) of the bladder . But GCP was not effective in lowering PSA levels in men with low-volume prostate cancer . Large scale clinical trials are needed to verify its anticancer potential.",,"In vitro experiments show that genistein inhibits tyrosine-specific protein kinase activity of EGF receptors. Inhibition is competitive with respect to ATP and noncompetitive to a phosphate acceptor, histone H2B. Genistein bears no structural relationship with ATP, so inhibition may not be due to true competition for the same active site as that utilized by ATP (8). Basidiomycete polysaccharides possess antitumor, antiviral, antibacterial and immune-modulating activities. The fermentation of soy extract with basidiomycetes deglycosylates the soy isoflavones which renders them in a highly absorbable form (7).In prostate cancer cells, GCP was found to inhibit mammalian target of rapamycin (MTOR) activity (4). MTOR is a downstream effector of Akt, an enzyme which plays an important role in cancer cell proliferation and survival (4).

DSI007831,Gerson Regimen,None,"Regimen developed by Max Gerson involving a strict metabolic diet, coffee enemas, and various supplements, including laetrile, which is illegal in the United States but available at clinics in Mexico and elsewhere. The diet emphasizes fresh fruit and vegetable juice, high carbohydrate and potassium, no sodium or fat, and low animal protein, and is sometimes supplemented with exogenous digestive enzymes. This regimen claims to address the cause of cancer by detoxifying the system and stimulating metabolism so that the body can heal itself . Coffee enemas can cause infections, dangerous electrolyte deficiencies, and death . Despite proponents’ claims of recovery rates as high as 70-90 percent, case reviews by the NCI and New York County Medical Society in 1947 found no evidence of anticancer effects with the Gerson diet . The only large, retrospective review of patient survival in the literature was conducted by the Gerson Research Organization. The American Cancer Society (ACS) warns that the Gerson method can be very harmful .",,"Gerson claims he originally developed the diet to treat his migraines, but found it a successful as a treatment for skin tuberculosis and stomach cancer (7). His therapy is based on the theory that cancer is caused by alteration of cell metabolism by toxic environmental substances and food processing, which changes the sodium and potassium content of foods. Gerson’s rationale is that cancer patients have low immunity and generalized tissue damage characterized by decreased intracellular potassium to sodium (K/Na) ratios, and, when their cancer is destroyed, toxic degradation products cause coma and death. His diet increases potassium intake and minimizes sodium consumption in an effort to correct the electrolyte imbalance, repair tissue, and detoxify the liver, while coffee enemas reportedly cause dilation of bile ducts and excretion of toxic breakdown products by the liver and through the colon wall. Supplemental potassium and oxidizing thyroid enzymes are given to introduce oxidation to cancer cells and kill them. None of these claims has been substantiated by scientific research (4) (6).
This regimen has resulted in coma-inducing low levels of sodium. Case reports of deaths from repeated administration of coffee enemas indicate that the practice causes a dangerous decrease in serum electrolytes. Coffee enemas have an osmolality of 62 mOsm/kg; repeated administration increases extravascular fluid volume and may cause electrolyte imbalances and subsequent death (5).
The ease of absorption of the high volumes of raw fruit and vegetables in this diet is questionable, especially in patients with GI cancers or chemotherapy-induced mucosal damage. While elements of the Gerson diet are similar to diet recommendations made by the USDA and the American Cancer Society, metabolic diets are unsuitable for some patients with disseminated or metastatic disease, particularly of the head, neck, and gut (1).",,Gerson diet; Gerson therapy | Gerson method; Gerson program | Gerson treatment; Gerson Institute,,,Gerson Regimen,
DSI007832,Glyconutrients,None,"Glyconutrients refer to 8 plant monosaccharides: galactose, glucose, arabinose, glucosamine, mannose, xylose, rhamnose, and fucose. Related products are mostly marketed by a company called Mannatech under the brand name Ambrotose. Proponents claim that these monosaccharides are essential for the body because they are building blocks of glycoproteins which are used for cell-to-cell communication. They also suggest that the modern diet is deficient in monosaccharides and that supplementation can restore cellular health and support the immune system . However, strong scientific evidence to support these claims is lacking. Glyconutrients are also promoted to cancer patients through network marketing approaches, but their benefit is unclear.",,"Although sugars such as glucose are essential for normal functioning of the body, true deficiencies are rare except in malnourished patients. Humans can convert saccharides into different forms according to the body’s needs. More complex polysaccharides, such as beta-glucan, have been studied for their immunomodulating effects, but it is unclear if the marketed products contain substantial amounts of such polysaccharides.
Even though some of the constituents have been investigated for their anticancer effects, none of them have been shown to be effective for cancer treatment. In a trial sponsored by Mannatech, Ambrotose was shown to enhance brain wave activities when compared to placebo. However, the clinical implication remains to be determined (2).",,"

DSI007833,HMB,None,"Beta-hydroxy-beta-methylbutyrate (HMB) is a metabolite of the amino acid leucine. It is often used as a body building supplement to help improve muscle strength by reducing protein breakdown. HMB is also added to some medical foods for patients with muscle wasting and cachexia. Small studies were initially conducted in active and younger men with mixed results on body composition and physical performance . A systematic review suggests that HMB may prevent exercise-related muscle damage in healthy trained and untrained individuals, as well as muscle loss during chronic disease . However, research on HMB in clinical populations is limited. Some studies in the elderly suggest HMB benefits vascular endothelial function , reduces muscle breakdown , decreases abdominal fat mass , improves functional recovery after hip fracture , and reduces mortality . Other small studies suggest HMB may improve pulmonary function in COPD patients and nitrogen balance in critically injured patients , but it did not reduce comorbidities in hemodialysis patients . Very few studies have been conducted in cancer populations. One small study suggests an HMB-containing supplement may help prevent radiation dermatitis in head and neck cancer patients . HMB is often used together with glutamine and arginine for muscle wasting and cachexia , but a larger randomized trial failed to demonstrate a significant effect . Meta-analyses suggest HMB may help increase muscle and strength in various clinical conditions, but the effect size was small , and little to no impact was seen when HMB supplementation was added to exercise in the elderly . The upcoming HEAL study may help elucidate any true effects of HMB in frail older adults .",,"HMB is metabolized from the branched chain amino acid L-leucine endogenously through alpha-ketoisocaproic acid. Since only a small amount is converted from food sources, supplementation is used to increase intake. As a dietary supplement, HMB usually comes in calcium salt or free acid forms, the latter which is thought to have higher bioavailability (21). In muscle cells, HMB stimulates cell growth and survival through MAPK/ERK pathways (22). HMB restored balance between intracellular protein synthesis and breakdown by activating PI3K/Akt-dependent mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) (23) (24). The stimulating effect of HMB on mTOR is eliminated with the introduction of rapamycin, an mTOR inhibitor (6) (25). However, it is unclear if HMB supplementation would also reduce the therapeutic effects of other mTOR inhibitors used in cancer treatment. HMB inhibits the ubiquitin-proteasome proteolytic pathway which governs the degradation of intracellular proteins (26) . In murine neuroblastoma cells, HMB exihibited neurotrophic effects (27).
In animal models, HMB reduced total subcutaneous fat content and LDL cholesterol (28), but did not affect circulating plasma levels of testosterone (4), cortisol, insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), or insulin (29).",,Beta-hydroxymethylbutyrate | Beta-hydroxy-beta-methylbutyrate monohydrate | Beta-hydroxyisovaleric acid | HMB-d6,,,HMB,
DSI007834,Homeopathy,None,"Homeopathy is a medical system developed 200 years ago by Dr. Samuel Hahnemann, a German physician. Promoted as a safer and more holistic approach to treating disease, it has remained especially popular in India and some European countries. Homeopathic remedies are highly diluted forms of botanical, animal, or mineral substances which when given in full strength to a healthy volunteer, cause the presenting symptoms of the patient. Opponents argue that the benefits experienced by patients are merely placebo effects , which are no larger than those observed in conventional medicine . In a US national survey, homeopathy was most commonly used for respiratory and otorhinolaryngology complaints . Observational studies suggest that certain homeopathic products can provide long-term relief from symptoms such as headache and allergic rhinitis in adults, and atopic dermatitis and recurrent infections in children . One study suggests benefit with an add-on homeopathic preparation for recurrent tonsillitis . However, adjuvant homeopathy was not helpful for otitis media with effusion , and systematic reviews found data on homeopathy for otitis media or chronic rhinosinusitis to be scant and of limited quality . Higher quality trials also do not support the use of homeopathic remedies for pediatric respiratory tract infections . Only a few studies have been conducted in psychological symptoms and are largely negative. An epidemiological study found only marginal improvement for anxiety and depression among those who consulted practitioners prescribing homeopathy versus conventional care , and another study on homeopathy for depression was terminated early due to recruitment difficulties . In addition, meta-analyses have determined that evidence on homeopathy for ADHD symptoms or psychiatric disorders is lacking , and The European Sleep Research Society does not recommend homeopathy for insomnia . Studies of homeopathy in cancer patients are limited. Various homeopathic care regimens adjunctive to cancer therapy appeared to improve global health status and wellbeing , fatigue , quality of life , and acute radiodermatitis , but not chemotherapy-induced emesis or endocrine therapy-related hot flushes . Other case reports suggest homeopathic remedies may be helpful for advanced cancer or post-treatment breast cancer pain , and a few in vitro studies suggest some homeopathic ingredients may have anticancer effects . However, these observations have not been evaluated in clinical trials and cancer patients should be aware that homeopathy is not a substitute for mainstream care. Unlike remedies used in classical homeopathy, some contemporary homeopathic products may actually contain ingredients in allopathic doses, which has raised concerns about potential adverse effects or drug interactions . In a meta-analysis, the rate of adverse effects from homeopathy was similar to studies that randomized patients to placebo and conventional medicine . The Canadian Paediatric Society states that particular homeopathic treatments called nosodes have not been proven effective against infectious disease and are not alternatives to vaccinations . In addition, homeopathic teething products have been associated with harm in infants, and some researchers recommend against homeopathic remedies in general to treat pediatric conditions .",,"The practice of homeopathy is governed by the Law of Similars: Similia similibus curanturor or “like cures like.” Hahnemann and his followers observed that while certain plants, animals or minerals could cause specific symptoms when ingested by healthy individuals, the highly diluted form of the same substance could relieve similar symptoms in ailing patients. Other principles include tailored treatment so that different people with the same condition may receive different regimens, and the “law of minimum dose” — the idea that a lower dose translates to greater effectiveness (38).
An in vitro study showed that an antidiabetic product commonly used in homeopathy demonstrated anticancer effects by inducing nuclear DNA fragmentation and increasing levels of mRNA expression of apoptotic signal related genes cytochrome c and caspase 3, and by reducing expression of antiapoptotic gene Bcl2 (5). Another product, Phytolacca decandra, exerted anticancer properties in melanoma cells via activation of caspase-mediated signaling and ROS generation (6). However, it is not known if these products will have the same effects when diluted according to homeopathic principles.
Several challenges endure with evaluating the efficacy of homeopathy, including obtaining adequate documentation from traditional practitioners (38), and its plausibility against known pharmacology principles (39).",,Homeopathic medicine | Homeopathic remedy,,,Homeopathy,

According to the inventor Harry Hoxsey, the principal “brown” tonic contains potassium iodide, licorice, red clover, burdock root, stillingia root, barberry, cascara, pokeweed, prickly ash bark, and buckthorn bark. The diet involves eliminating pork, vinegar, tomatoes, pickles, carbonated drinks, alcohol, bleached flour, sugar and salt, and emphasizes iron, calcium, vitamin C, yeast supplements and grape juice. Hoxsey claims the treatment detoxifies the body, strengthens the immune system, balances body chemistry, and allows the body to digest and excrete tumors. Superoxide dismutase, vitamin B12, Gerovital (a mixture of procaine hydrochloride and vitamins), “Prolobin liver,” TST-100, rosette cactus, Koch Antitoxins, BCG vaccine, and Shulte’s medications sometimes are included in the regimen. Hoxsey was convicted many times for practicing medicine without a license. The U.S. government reported that the 400 patients Hoxsey claimed to have cured never had cancer, were cured before receiving his treatment, still had cancer, or had died from the disease . The National Cancer Institute evaluated 77 case reports submitted by Hoxsey and concluded that none showed efficacy . No clinical data support the value of this therapy. The American Cancer Society strongly urges cancer patients not to use the Hoxsey treatment, as no objective evidence exists to support its efficacy .",,"Hoxsey claims that the internal formulation “stimulates the elimination of toxins that poison the system, thereby correcting the abnormal blood chemistry and normalizing cell metabolism.” His head nurse added that it restores acid/base balance, normal metabolism, and immune function, and “deals with the DNA.” None of these claims is substantiated by scientific data. The herbal tonic was developed by Hoxsey’s great grandfather, whose horse was reportedly cured of a leg tumor after eating wild herbs. Hoxsey combined these herbs with home remedies to create the “brown” tonic.

In vitro and animal studies indicate anti-inflammatory , antitumor , antiangiogenic , and neuroprotective effects. Indirubin also inhibits cyclin-dependent kinases in tumor cells . A derivative of indirubin enhanced the cytotoxic effects of adriamycin . Studies of indirubin in humans are limited. A few clinical trials suggest topical I. naturalis ointment is effective for psoriasis and atopic dermatitis . Oral I. naturalis induced a clinical response in ulcerative colitis , but the trial was stopped due to a prior case of pulmonary arterial hypertension, possibly related to a self-purchased product . In addition, a subsequent national survey in Japan identified 11 cases of PAH in UC patients as well as other adverse events . Short-term indigo administration in patients with mild to moderate UC appeared to be effective without serious adverse events, but the study was small and additional research is needed . In patients with Crohn’s disease, preliminary analyses suggest only modest benefit . Interim trial analysis of oral chemotherapy with an I. naturalis formulation versus intravenous chemotherapy for acute promyelocytic leukemia suggests it is as effective and may reduce hospital stays , but the final analysis has yet to be published. A small study of indirubin in the form of indigowood root powder for patients with head and neck cancer found a reduction in mucosal damage from radiation therapy . Although there are case reports of positive effects following long-term use of indirubin in CML , well-designed clinical trials are needed to confirm its role.",,"Aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) ligand, the active component of Indigo naturalis, may promote mucosal healing via induction of IL-22 from innate lymphoid cells (30).

In human skin samples, indirubin produced anti-psoriatic effects by modulating proliferation and differentiation of keratinocytes (10).
Anticancer and neuroprotective properties are attributed to inhibition of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) and glycogen synthase kinase-3 by competing with ATP binding sites (31). Indirubin-3-oxime inhibits growth of human laryngeal cancer cells via CDK inhibitor p21, cyclin D1 inhibition, and caspase-3 activation (1).

It used several treatments to stimulate the immune system, including a strict vegetarian diet, BCG vaccine, coffee enemas, autogenous vaccine, vitamins, antibiotics, antioxidants, nutritional counseling, and support groups/counseling. The regimen was based on the theory that cancer was caused by the bacterium Progenitor cryptocides, which developer Virginia Livingston-Wheeler reported to have isolated in a wide variety of cancer tissues . A weakened immune system would then allow the bacterium to grow, and consequently the therapy’s focus was immune-stimulation. Although a number of viruses and bacteria have been associated with various cancers , a link between the bacteria named by Livingston-Wheeler and cancer was never confirmed by independent researchers. A self-selected, matched-cohort, prospective comparison of patients at Livingston-Wheeler Clinic and a conventional cancer center found no difference in survival times between groups, but did find consistently lower quality of life in the Livingston-Wheeler cohort .

DSI007842,Ma Zi Ren Wan,C3884847,"Ma Zi Ren Wan (MZRW) is a traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) formula with a long history of use as a treatment for constipation. Documented in Shang Han Lun (TCM Treatise on Cold-induced Disorders), it consists of six herbs: Huo Ma Ren (Fructus Cannabis), Da Huang (Radix et Rhizoma Rhei), Bai Shao (Radix Paeoniae Alba), Xing Ren (Semen Armeniacae Amarum), Zhi Shi (Fructus Aurantii Immaturus), and Hou Pu (Cortex Magnoliae Officinalis). According to a systematic review, MZRW is the most commonly used herbal formula for constipation in China , particularly by elderly patients and women . A population-based study reported it is also among the formulas commonly prescribed to prostate cancer patients in Taiwan . Much of available data of MZRW’s clinical effects are limited to Asian populations. In a three-armed randomized controlled trial involving patients with functional constipation, MZRW was found to be equally effective as senna, a popular herbal laxative, in increasing complete spontaneous bowel movement (CSBM). Compared to the senna and placebo groups, the MZRW arm also had a significant increase in colonic transit along with decreased severity in straining, constipation, incomplete evacuation, and global constipation symptoms. Benefits were also more durable in the MZRW group . Similar improvements have been reported in other randomized double-blind studies. Patients with functional constipation who took MZRW had increased CSBM and reductions in constipation severity and use of rescue therapy compared to the placebo group . In a pilot RCT for palliative cancer patients with constipation, modified MZRW was well-tolerated, increased in stool frequency, and reduced constipation severity and straining versus placebo . A systematic review and meta-analysis (17 trials, 1681 patients) concluded that MZRW is beneficial against functional constipation in Asian populations. In addition, MZRW did not increase adverse events compared to controls . Of note, four studies in this review involved pediatric and adult cancer patients with chemotherapy-induced and opioid-associated constipation.

DSI007843,Magnet Therapy,None,"Magnet therapy is an alternative treatment available in clinics in Mexico, Germany, and elsewhere. It is promoted to diagnose and treat cancer, AIDS, psychiatric disorders, stress, multiple sclerosis, infections, and to increase energy, prolong life, and stimulate the immune system. Magnetic fields are administered by application of magnets to certain parts of the body, by magnetic field-generating machines, or with magnetic mattresses or blankets. Treatment can last minutes to weeks. Evidence supporting the use of magnetic therapies for the above conditions is limited. State consumer protection agencies and the FDA have prosecuted various marketers of magnetized devices and therapies, forcing them to halt unsubstantiated claims of health benefits. In vitro studies show that static magnetic fields may modulate ion transport and related cell and neuronal activity , but the physiological significance of these findings is unknown. No anticancer activity has been demonstrated. Patients also use magnetized braces and mattresses to treat pain associated with fibromyalgia, diabetic neuropathy, sciatica, and arthritis. Although small studies have reported improvements in pain associated with conditions such as diabetic neuropathy , fibromyalgia , and arthritis , results are often indistinguishable from placebo effects. Some preliminary findings suggest pulsed magnetic therapy may help alleviate paresthesia better than placebo in patients with multiple sclerosis , and reduce pain and disability in patients with back pain . Also, synchronized transcranial magnetic stimulation may be useful in patients with major depressive disorder , but these are specific technologies that are still being evaluated in clinical settings for potential safety and efficacy. Body magnets are contraindicated in radiology and/or magnetic resonance procedures. Patients with cardiac pacemakers and pregnant women should also avoid use of magnetic devices. Magnetic therapies have no role in the diagnosis or treatment of cancer.",,"Marketers make varying unsubstantiated claims for how magnets work, such as: magnets “act upon the body’s energy field,” or correct “magnetic field deficiency syndrome,” (1) a condition said to result from decreases in the earth’s magnetic field over the past 1,000 years. It is purported that the positive (south) pole of the magnet has a “stress effect,” which interferes with metabolic functioning, produces acidity, reduces cellular oxygen supply, and encourages the replication of latent microorganisms. The negative (north) pole is said to have a “calming effect” and helps to normalize metabolic functioning, promote oxygenation, and treat neurological/psychiatric disorders. No evidence supports these claims, and no anticancer activity is seen with magnetic fields in laboratory or human studies. Most anecdotes of magnetic “healing” involve symptoms that may be psychosomatic, associated with stress, or subjective measures such as pain or depression (3).
Theoretically, static magnetic fields (SMFs) may alter ion flow, cellular potential, membrane configuration, ion pump activity, or neurotransmitter release (4). Most of the biological phenomena associated with SMFs may be caused by changes in cellular calcium (8). SMFs of 1,000-4,000 G are found to alter protein and enzyme structure and the kinetics of reactions involving free radicals (7) (9). Reduced action potential firing in cultured neurons and permeability changes in synthetic liposome vesicles are observed after application of a SMF (5). It may not be legitimate to extrapolate in vitro data in which cells are directly exposed to magnetic fields, to their effect in a complex biological system. Moreover, many in vitro studies have not been replicated. Although some authors refer to documented effects of pulsed electromagnetic fields in attempting to explain a mechanism of action for static magnets, SMFs do not generate an electric field and therefore cannot confer the claimed physiologic effects (10). It is suggested that positive reports of magnet use reflect placebo effects.",,Biomagnetic therapy | Electromagnetic field therapy,,,Magnet Therapy,

In preclinical studies, various formulations suggest protective effects against parasites , high insulin and lipid levels , and inflammation . Antitumor potential , enhanced bone marrow colony formation, reduced doxorubicin toxicity , and enhanced interferon activity have also been shown. In murine models, orally administered extracts promoted maturation of hematopoietic cells to functionally active myeloid cells, enhanced peripheral blood leukocyte recovery following chemotoxic bone marrow injury , and protected against cyclophosphamide-induced immunosuppression . Data in humans are limited. In a small case series, tumor regression or significant improvements in symptoms were observed in some subjects who took maitake extract . In small trials, oral maitake extract appeared to have immunomodulatory effects in postmenopausal breast cancer patients , and enhanced neutrophil and monocyte function in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome . More studies are underway to evaluate maitake’s anticancer potential.",,"Preclinical studies suggest antidiabetic effects with alpha-glucan via increased insulin sensitivity on insulin receptors and decreased insulin resistance in peripheral target tissues (12). Antilipidemic effects with maitake polysaccharides occurred by modulating gut microbial phylotypes and regulating genes involved in hepatic lipid and cholesterol metabolism (34).
In other experiments, maitake activated various effector cells such as macrophages, NK and T cells, IL-1, and superoxide anions (2) (3) (4) (13). It may modulate antigen presentation by protecting against tumor implantation following transfer of dendritic cells from tumor-bearing mice treated with maitake (15). Maitake D fraction demonstrated antitumor activity by upregulating proapoptotic BAK-1 (23), blocking tumor invasiveness, and reducing angiogenesis (26).

Methylglyoxal, a phytochemical, is the major bactericidal factor and promotes free radical generation (14) (21). Manuka honey was shown to reduce motility of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a gram negative bacterium and opportunistic pathogen, by suppressing genes associated with its flagella, thereby reducing virulence (34). It also inhibited the formation of biofilm, a complex polysaccharide structure produced by some bacteria such as Clostridium dificile, which confers antibiotic resistance (30). Anti-ulcer effects are attributed to increased gastric mucosal levels of glutathione peroxidase and superoxide dismutase and reductions of inflammatory cytokines including tumor necrosis factor (TNF-alpha), Interleukins 1-beta and 6 (27).
Manuka honey enhanced effects of antioxidants in animal studies (15) and promoted wound healing by modulating cytokine production (4) and lowering pH on wound surfaces (16).

DSI007846,Metabolic Therapies,None,"As strict dietary and detoxification regimens promoted to prevent and treat cancer and degenerative diseases, metabolic therapies are based on the theory that these conditions are caused by an accumulation of toxic substances in the body. Advocates claim that a healthy diet and practices including coffee enemas, herbal laxatives, and immune augmentation detoxify the body and allow it to heal naturally. Therapies such as Gerson, Kelley, Contreras, Manner, and Gonzalez share this ideology but differ in modality. The diets are often based on whole foods including fresh fruits and vegetables, and are supplemented by digestive enzymes, glandular extracts, megadose vitamins, minerals, or herbal products. Agents such as hydrazine sulphate, hydrogen peroxide, or laetrile may also be administered. Retrospective reviews of the Gerson, Kelley, and Contreras therapies show no evidence of efficacy. Results from a study involving patients with inoperable pancreatic cancer showed a decrease in overall survival and poorer quality of life with proteolytic enzymes, often used to supplement a metabolic therapy diet, compared with standard gemcitabine-based chemotherapy . Although dietary remedies provide a strong sense of personal control, the strict recommendations of some metabolic therapies can cause nutritional deficiencies, while some entail potentially toxic doses of supplements or agents. Coffee enemas can cause sepsis, dangerous electrolyte deficiencies, and death. The American Cancer Society urges cancer patients not to seek treatment with metabolic therapies.",,"Advocates of metabolic therapies claim that cancer and other diseases result from an accumulation of toxins in the body from food additives, preservatives, pesticides, and industrial pollution that disrupt the immune system and cell metabolism. The removal of these toxins through bowel purging and a healthy diet, they claim, allows the body to heal naturally. While diet may play a role in cancer prevention and some cancers are associated with environmental exposures, strict dietary restrictions, as in the Gerson regimen, cause nutritional deficiencies.
Caffeine in coffee enemas is purported to cause dilation of bile ducts, bile production, glutathione S-transferase (GST) activation, and excretion of toxic breakdown products by the liver and through the colon wall. Kahweol and cafestol are constituents of green coffee that stimulate GST activation, but their activity is destroyed with roasting. Repeated administration of coffee enemas increases extravascular fluid volume and can cause serum electrolyte imbalances. Significant loss of bile salts associated with repeated long-term administration of enemas can result in malabsorption of fat, fat-soluble vitamins, and calcium (2) (3) (4).

It is used in traditional medicine to treat hemorrhoids, ulcers, leprosy, and as an abortifacient. The plant is poisonous because of oleandrin, a cardiac glycoside with structure and actions similar to those of digoxin, and both exert their effects by inhibiting membrane enzyme Na+, K+ -ATPase . Most studies have focused on the anticancer activities of oleandrin because of its apoptotic effects in various cancer cell lines . It also increases sensitivity of PC-3 human prostate cells to radiotherapy and reduces gentamycin toxicity . A study in glioma models suggest potential activity . In other studies, oleandrin demonstrated neuroprotective activity and reduced infectivity of the HIV virus . A hot water extract of the plant, known as Anvirzel™, has been developed as a potential treatment for cancer, AIDS, and congestive heart failure. It consists of a mixture of oleandrin and the glycone oleandrigenin. Preclinical experiments suggest that a combination of Anvirzel and cisplatin may be more effective than cisplatin monotherapy .

A methanolic extract of taheebo inhibited cell proliferation through the extracelluar signal regulated kinase (ERK1/2) mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway (10).
Lapachol’s anticoagulant activity is due to the inhibition of vitamin K epoxide and quinone reductases, an action similar to that of warfarin (14).

Randomized controlled trials have reported benefits of psilocybin-assisted therapy for Tobacco use disorder (1) Alcohol use disorder (2) Treatment-resistant depression (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) Systematic reviews/meta-analyses showed Improvements in end-of-life anxiety (9) Positive effects on existential and spiritual well-being, quality of life and acceptance in patients with terminal illness (10) Effectiveness comparable to escitalopram for long-standing depression (11) Preliminary findings also suggest beneficial effects in individuals with Obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) (12) Cluster headaches (13) (14) Migraines (15) Demoralization with an AIDS diagnosis (16) In cancer patients with psychological distress, psilocybin affected Reductions in suicidal ideation (17) Rapid, significant, and sustained reductions in depression and anxiety (18) (19) (20) Notably, mystical experience – characterized by deep feelings of meaning/sacredness, interconnectedness, transcendence of time and space, and a strong positive mood – was positively correlated with reductions in depression (18). Microdosing: Consuming very low doses of psychedelics for improving mood, concentration, creativity, and cognitive function is also gaining popularity. Studies are mixed on whether microdosing can improve mood and mental health . A case series suggests it may relieve chronic neuropathic pain . Legal Status: Under federal law, the use, sale and possession of psilocybin is illegal. Given the promising preliminary data, the USFDA granted “breakthrough therapy” status to psilocybin in 2018 for treatment-resistant depression, and in 2019 for major depressive disorder. This designation can help minimize the burden of federal regulations that impede research and drug development. Many states are also moving toward decriminalizing psilocybin for therapeutic or recreational purposes: Oregon became the first to both decriminalize and legalize psilocybin for therapeutic use, with ballot initiatives underway in Colorado and California . The American Psychiatric Association supports research into psychedelics, but states that “clinical treatments should be determined by scientific evidence in accordance with applicable regulatory standards and not by ballot initiatives or popular opinion” . In Summary, emerging evidence suggests that psilocybin improves mental health outcomes in patients with multiple psychiatric conditions. With increasing public interest and acceptance of psychedelic therapies, larger trials with more diverse populations, standardized dosages, stronger blinding/controls, research on long-term effects, as well as clear regulations and guidelines are needed to inform future clinical practice . It is important to note that although psilocybin has low potential of addiction and is associated with lower risk of adverse effects compared to other psychoactive drugs such as LSD or MDMA, it can cause acute psychological distress, dangerous behavior and sustained psychological discomfort in uncontrolled environments . Individuals who abuse psilocybin mushrooms may also risk poisoning because their morphological similarities to some poisonous mushrooms could lead to misidentification.",,"Psilocin, the active metabolite of psilocybin, is known to produce perceptual changes, altering one’s awareness of surroundings, thoughts, and feelings. These effects are exerted primarily via serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine) type 2A receptor agonism (30). This functional selectivity to the 5-HT2A receptor leads to releasing increased levels of glutamate, which may also contribute to the psychedelic effects. The visual hallucinations associated with psilocin are likely due to overexpression of 5-HT2A receptors in the visual cortex (31).
Additionally, psilocybin is thought to decrease negative affect and the neural correlates of negative affect, thought to be one of the mechanisms underlying its effects against a variety of mental disorders (32).
Following oral consumption, the bioavailability of psilocin was reported to be approximately 50%, with detectable levels in the plasma after 30 min (33). Recent studies using a 25 mg dose of psilocybin found the onset of action at 20-40 minutes with effects peaking at 60-90 minutes, and active duration between 4-6 hours (34). The Tmax (maximal plasma concentration) was 18.7 ng/ml - 20 ng/ml at 120 minutes (35) (36). Nearly 80% of the circulating psilocin is metabolized by hepatic phase II glucuronidation (conjugation) through UGT 1A10 and UGT 1A9 enzymes. Psilocin is completely excreted within 24 h with much of it occurring within the first 8 h (33) (37).",,Magic mushrooms | Shrooms | Boomers | Buttons | Purple passion | Mushies (>12 other terms),,,Psilocybin,

DSI007858,Scorpion Venom,C0036450,"The scorpion is a predatory arthropod represented by more than 1500 different species worldwide . As part of the diverse arachnid class, scorpions possess a venomous stinger at the end of their tails used to paralyze prey or for self-defense. Although the venom is generally considered poisonous, there are varying degrees of pathogenicity and only a small fraction of scorpion species are deadly to humans . The belief that scorpions have medicinal properties has existed for centuries, and many instances of their use have been recorded in both indigenous and folk medicine. In Traditional Chinese Medicine, the entire scorpion of the Buthus martensii Karsch (BmK) species is used to treat convulsions, spasms, and pain , and some laboratory studies confirm that scorpion venoms do contain antinociceptive properties . Scorpion venom has also been evaluated for other applications. It appears useful in killing intraerythrocytic malarial pathogens without harming the erythrocyte , and some species contain antimicrobial peptides that appear effective against yeast, fungi, bacteria, and viruses . Scorpion venom could also be a source for the isolation of anticancer molecules. Preliminary assessments indicate that Tityus discrepans, Androctonus crassicauda, and Odontobuthus doriae venoms are inducers of apoptosis in breast cancer cell lines . A component in BmK venom inhibits proliferation of human leukemia cells suggesting therapeutic potential in hematopoietic malignancies . Because the general composition and expression level of scorpion venom depends on genetic variations and geographical environments, research to identify the active components that have therapeutic potential across the various species continues . Rhopalurus junceus, or blue scorpion venom, originated from Cuba, and is often marketed as having anticancer, anti-inflammatory, and analgesic properties. Claims for these products, known as Escozine and Escozul, are largely based on anecdotal information, testimonials, and preclinical experiments on laboratory animals. However, the manufacturers’ research cannot be corroborated and has not been published in any peer-reviewed journal . In 2009, the Cuban government formally rejected the use of Escozul due to insufficient clinical data . Only recently has there been a functional characterization of R. junceus in the literature, but without any clinical evidence presented for R. junceus-derived products . A homeopathic version, Vidatox, has since been developed and has also not been evaluated in peer-reviewed journals. The more likely scenario for future benefits with scorpion venom in cancer therapy may come from clinical trials involving chlorotoxin (CTX), a scorpion venom-derived peptide. CTX may facilitate the entry of chemotherapeutic compounds into tumor cells to target drug delivery and improve efficacy . In addition, it holds the potential for reducing side effects and can be synthesized in the laboratory . A synthetic CTX that selectively binds to glioma and other tumors cells is being evaluated as a radiopharmaceutical to deliver therapeutic levels of radiation directly to disease sites . A CTX/near-infrared fluorescent molecule combination is under investigation as a cancer imaging agent, a kind of “tumor paint” that may help surgeons more clearly identify tumor margins and micrometastases, and spare normal tissue . Continued research on the complex characteristics of scorpion venom among the various species is needed to both isolate the properties of therapeutic importance and develop their application in cancer research.",,"The sheer number of compounds and their diverse pharmacologic properties among different scorpion species leaves their mechanisms poorly understood (12) (31). Most scorpion venoms are known to contain peptide toxins that mainly act on ion channels (29). These biologically active peptides are classified as either disulfide-bridged peptides (DBPs) which are mostly responsible for neurotoxic effects, and non-disulfide-bridged (NDBPs) which have been an attractive area of research for their spectrum of biological activities (36).
Hp1036 and Hp1239 peptides are antiviral and exert inhibitory effects throughout the Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) life cycle (37). TsAP-1 and TsAP-2 peptides possess antimicrobial and anticancer activity that can be substantially improved with increased cationicity (38). AcrAP1 and AcrAP2 analogues have also displayed enhanced antimicrobial activity and growth modulation effects on a range of human cancer cell lines (39). Peptides are also being engineered to produce selective therapeutic ion channel inhibitors which may have potential against autoimmune diseases (40). A fusion protein generated from chlorotoxin inhibited matrix metalloproteinase-2 release from pancreatic cancer cells, which require their activation during invasion and migration (41).
The venom from R. junceus was shown to have reversible beta and alpha activities. It enabled sodium channels to open at more negative potentials, delayed inactivation of potassium channels, and rapidly blocked ERG potassium channels in neuroblastoma cells (18). Proteins found in T. discrepans venom bind to FasL and Bcl-2 on the surface of breast cancer cells inducing apoptosis (9). Buthus matensii Karsch (BmK) scorpion venom extracts inhibited human breast cancer cells by inducing apoptosis and blocking cell cycle in G0/G1 phase (42). BmK venom also induces apoptosis in human lymphoma cells by upregulating PTEN, and decreases levels of Akt and Bad phosphorylation, resulting in increased p27 expression (32). Another component of BmK venom inhibits cell proliferation by modulating NF-κB activation in human leukemia cells (12). Bengalin, a high molecular weight protein from the Indian black scorpion induced autophagy in human leukemic cells through ERK-MAPK pathway (43). A. crassicauda and O. doriae venoms induce apoptosis via caspase-3 activity and nuclear DNA fragmentation in neuroblastoma and breast cancer cells (10) (11). Further, the proteolytic enzymes in scorpion venom are likely responsible for its necrotic activity (11). Leiurus quinquestriatus venom contains a chlorotoxin (CTX) associated with MMP2 that increases its affinity for primary brain tumors and reduces the potential for tumor invasion of healthy tissue (20) (21). CTX, which functions as a paralytic in nature, has a molecular structure with a single tyrosine residue available for radioiodination (33). Synthetic CTX has shown antiangiogenic properties and a synergistic effect with bevacizumab in animal models (24) and specifically binds with the protein annexin A2 in diverse tumor cell lines (34).
An array of other components in scorpion venoms may have therapeutic uses. BmK venom has sympathomimetic and analgesic properties (30) (35). It contains a peptide that modulates G-protein-coupled receptor activity, and has a primary structure similar to enkephalin-like peptides (31). Other venoms also exhibit antinociceptive properties which appear to be activated by an endogenous opioid system partly triggered by counterirritation (5).",,Blue scorpion,,,Scorpion Venom,

DSI007860,Ling,C0452995,"Shen Ling Bai Zhu San (SLBZS) is a traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) formula with a long medicinal history as a treatment for chronic diarrhea. First described in the ancient medical text Tai Ping Hui Min He Ji Ju Fang, it consists of 10 herbs: Ren Shen (Panax ginseng C.A. Mey or Asian Ginseng), Fu Ling (Poria cocos (Schw.) wolf), Bai Zhu (Adactylies macrocephala Koidz Rhizome), Gan Cao (Glycyrrhiza uralensis fisch or Licorice), Bai Bian Dou (Dolichos lablab), Shan Yao (Dioscore opposita thumb), Lian Zi (Nelumbo nucifera), Jie Geng (Platycodon grandifloras (Jacq.) A. DC.), Sha Ren (Amomum villosum Lour.), and Yi Yi Ren (Coix lacryma-jobi L. var. ma-yuen (Roman.) Stapf). Today, SLBZS continues to be used by practitioners in the Asia-Pacific region to manage chronic diarrhea and is the second most prescribed formula for post-surgery colon cancer patients in Taiwan . Clinical data are largely limited to Asian population. A pilot, four-arm, randomized controlled trial of patients with diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (D-IBS) found SLBZS to be associated with improvements in D-IBS symptoms. In addition, abdominal pain and frequency, discomfort, and stool form showed greater improvements in patients who took SLBZS with or without otilonium bromide, an antispasmodic drug, compared to the otilonium bromide and placebo groups. Notably, patients in the SLBZS and SLBZS + otilonium bromide arms had fewer adverse events compared to those in the otilonium bromide and placebo groups . In patients with ulcerative colitis, both SLBZS and modified SLBZS were found to be more effective than the first-line therapy mesalamine for controlling diarrhea, abdominal pain and fever . A large review found SLBZS to be the second most prescribed formula for ulcerative colitis, citing the need for well-designed studies . This formula was also superior to the quinolone antibiotic norfloxacin for symptom management in patients with chronic diarrhea of unknown etiology . A systematic review and meta-analysis (14 trials, 1158 patients with ulcerative colitis, chronic diarrhea and D-IBS) reported significant improvements in patient-reported satisfaction with SLBZS or SLBZS combined with conventional medicine compared with conventional medicine alone; and pooled analysis of 9 trials showed that SLBZS did not increase the risk of adverse effects compared with controls . Additional methodologically robust trials are needed to bolster the evidence base surrounding SLBZS. Because diarrhea is associated with many gastrointestinal disorders, future studies should also use a global diagnostic code of gastrointestinal disease to yield unambiguous data.",,"Pharmacological studies suggest that SLBZS promotes the integrity of intestinal barrier, regulates inflammatory factors, and modulates gut microbiota by reducing the levels of potential pathogens and increasing those of beneficial bacteria (9)(10) (11) (12).

Sho-saiko-to is used in traditional medicine to treat fever, gastrointestinal disorders, chronic liver diseases , stomatitis, and oral mucositis . In animal models, Sho-saiko-to inhibited hepatic necroinflammation and fibrosis , prevented liver injury, and promoted liver regeneration . Other experiments show it can enhance various aspects of immune functioning . Preclinical studies also suggest antiproliferative effects in hepatoma and ovarian cancer cell lines . Morphological analysis of cells grown in the presence of Sho-saiko-to show evidence of apoptosis . In humans, a clinical study showed that Sho-saiko-to may improve liver pathology in hepatitis C patients who do not respond to interferon-based treatment . In older studies, Sho-saiko-to decreased serum AST and ALT values in patients with chronic active hepatitis and appeared to reduce incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma in cirrhotic patients . However, the prescribing information for this product recommends against its use in patients with liver cirrhosis or cancer, or in patients with liver dysfunction/chronic hepatitis and a below-normal platelet count, and further indicates that patients should have a “moderately strong constitution”. In addition, a meta-analysis determined that the efficacy of Sho-saiko-to for chronic hepatitis B is unclear, with small trials of low methodological quality . Because its use is associated with interstitial pneumonitis , liver injuries , and hepatitis , Sho-saiko-to should only be used under the supervision of a qualified practitioner.",,"Preclinical experiments show that Sho-saiko-to may enhance various aspects of immune function including effects on natural killer cells (12), interleukins (9), interferon gamma (10) (18), and macrophages (11) (13). Its regulation of the cytokine production system may help to explain effects on disease progression, as Sho-saiko-to induced IL-10, an anti-inflammatory cytokine, while suppressing IL-4 and IL-5 in peripheral blood mononuclear cell cultures from patients with chronic active hepatitis (9). It is also a mild inducer of tumor necrosis factor-alpha and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, cytokines that play key roles in biological defense mechanisms (14).
Animal studies suggest Sho-saiko-to may prevent liver fibrosis and preneoplastic lesions by inhibiting stellate cells (7), the activation of which has been identified as a main driver of fibrosis in liver injury (29). Fibrotic inhibition has also been attributed to Nrf2 pathway upregulation against oxidative stress (30). Sho-saiko-to regulates temporal gene expression in mouse hepatocytes by way of microRNA (23).

Squalamine alters shape and volume of endothelial cells in embryonic vascular beds, causing narrowing of the vessel lumen and occluding blood flow (10). These actions inhibit multiple key steps in angiogenesis, including mitogen-induced actin polymerization, cell-cell adhesion, and cell migration, ultimately inhibiting endothelial cell proliferation.

SZRT is the most commonly prescribed formula for managing insomnia in Taiwan . Clinical studies of SZRT have been largely conducted in Asian populations. In a randomized controlled trial of adults with chronic insomnia, adjuvant use of SZRT with Lorazepam led to greater reductions in insomnia severity index with fewer side effects compared to Lorazepam alone. The combination reduced anxiety as well, although there were no significant between-group differences in depression scores. Participants also reported higher physical functioning at 12 weeks . In another study of methadone-maintained patients with disturbed sleep, SZRT affected significant improvements in patient-reported sleep quality and efficiency compared to placebo. However, there were no significant between-group differences in anxiety and depression scores or heroin craving . Additionally, an observational study found SZRT to enhance daytime functioning in climacteric women with poor sleep quality. Of note, women with severe menopause rating scale (MRS) scores had greater improvements compared to those with mild/moderate MRS scores . Among cancer patients with insomnia, modified SZRT formulas affected significant reductions in fatigue and insomnia severity index , and anxiety scores . A systematic review/meta-analysis determined that SZRT confers short-term benefits in individuals with sleep disturbance or insomnia. The improvements in sleep quality were significantly greater compared to placebo or waitlist control with comparable effects to benzodiazepine or cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) .

Miraculin alters taste in primates but not in rodents (8). Maximum taste-modifying activity is observed at pH 3.0, which allows two key histidine residues to facilitate cooperative binding, dimerization and miraculin-to-receptor binding in an acidic environment (10). Only the dimeric and tetrameric forms of miraculin are active (11). In a weakly acidic environment, miraculin acts as a positive allosteric modulator; at neutral pH, it acts as an antagonist that can inhibit the activity of other sweeteners including sucrose, saccharine and aspartame (8).

Furthermore, Triphala may actually promote oral bacterial biofilm formation . Other preliminary data suggest immunostimulatory effects , reversal of oral precancerous lesions , and improved HDL cholesterol and blood sugar levels . However, a double-blind study of Triphala in combination with guggulu showed no benefit on serum cholesterol levels, BMI, or waist circumference .",,"Polyphenolic compounds and flavonoids found in Triphala are thought to be responsible for many of its effects. Gallic acid, a major polyphenol, has antioxidant and immunomodulatory properties (11) (33).
In preclinical studies, Terminalia chebula inhibited hyaluronidase and collagenase to prevent cartilage degradation (7). Antiarthritic and anti-inflammatory effects of Triphala are attributed to NF-kBp65 and COX-2 inhibition (25) (26), whereas the anticolitic effects are attributed to antioxidant properties (22). Nephrotoxic effects were also thought to be attenuated via increased antioxidant activity (23).
Triphala appears to stimulate neutrophil function and decrease corticosterone levels in immunized rats exposed to noise stress (34). It also exerted radioprotective effects (21) by inhibiting oxidative damage. Triphala increased ROS in breast cancer cells resulting in apoptosis (8), protected against X-radiation and bleomycin, both of which generate DNA strand breaks in HeLa cells (42), and appeared to protect mice from radiation-induced mortality (2) (3).
Despite its antibacterial properties, compounds in Triphala may promote the formation of oral bacterial biofilm via activation of glucosyl transferases (30).
In a small study of healthy human volunteers, Triphala increased cytotoxic T cells and NK cells (31).",,Triphala churna | Triphala choornam | Phala trika,,,Triphala,

DSI007870,Viacreme,None,"Viacreme is a topical formulation of menthol and L-arginine in an aqueous base. It is promoted to enhance sexual responsiveness in women by sensitizing the genital area. Cancer patients may experience symptoms of sexual dysfunction that include painful intercourse, loss of libido, and difficulty in maintaining arousal. These problems may be caused by factors such as stress, hormonal changes, and treatment involving surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, or hormone therapy. Application of Viacreme is believed to cause genital warming and increase clitoral sensitivity, although these results may be due to placebo effects. No clinical trials have been conducted to study the efficacy of Viacreme. Use of Viacreme may cause a sensation of strong genital burning. This product has not been studied in cancer patients.",,Menthol (0.25 - 0.5%) in Viacreme is thought to facilitate absorption of L-arginine and cause increase in vaginal lubrication.

DSI007871,Wheat grass,C1455751,"Wheat grass is prepared by sprouting wheat seeds in water for 7–10 days before harvesting the leaves. Because the leaves are fibrous and difficult to digest, the juice from the leaves is extracted and consumed raw. Proponents believe the enzymes responsible for detoxifying the body are deactivated by the cooking process. Wheat grass is also marketed as a nutritional supplement in powder form. Wheat grass juice has been claimed to neutralize toxins and carcinogens in the body, prevent tooth decay, reduce high blood pressure, and aid in the treatment and prevention of cancer and AIDS. It is also used to improve digestion, and for common colds, cough, rheumatic pain, chronic fatigue syndrome, ulcers, and skin conditions. However, none of these claims are supported by clinical studies. Wheat grass proponents also equate its major constituent chlorophyll to hemoglobin, and believe that wheat grass consumption can increase oxygenation in the body. However, these concepts are not supported by current scientific understanding. Animal models suggest that wheat grass may have hypolipidemic and antioxidant effects. Preliminary studies in humans suggest wheat grass supplementation may reduce plasma lipid peroxidation in healthy volunteers engaged in regular exercise or atherogenic lipoproteins in hyperlipidemic women . A small study and systematic review indicate that wheat grass juice may be helpful for ulcerative colitis . Other studies are mixed on whether it can reduce the need for transfusions in patients with thalassemia major . Wheat grass juice may decrease myelotoxicity in breast cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy . There is also a report that it can reduce serum ferritin in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome . Larger studies are needed to evaluate these findings. Nausea has been reported following consumption of wheat grass juice. Because it is consumed raw, microbial contamination is also a concern.",,"Wheat grass is a natural source of vitamins and minerals including vitamins A, C, E, K and B-complex, as well as iron, calcium, magnesium, and selenium. It also contains chlorophyll, amino acids, bioflavonoids such as apigenin, and phenolic compounds  (3) (9) (10) (11). Some components may have antioxidant effects, as increases in glutathione and vitamin C levels have been noted (2) (4). Reductions in neutropenic fever and infection with wheat grass may relate to anti-inflammatory properties of apigenin, which can inhibit adhesion of leucocytes to endothelial cells (9) (12). Some constituents may have iron chelation activity (13).
In animal models, hypolipidemic effects occur through increased fecal cholesterol excretion (1), decreased total cholesterol and malondialdehyde levels, and increased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (2).

DSI007872,Xiao Yao San,C2605266,"Xiao Yao San (XYS) is a traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) formula documented in Tai Ping Hui Min He Ji Ju Fang, a collection of prescriptions written during the Song Dynasty around 1078-1085 AD. It consists of eight herbs: Bupleuri radix (Chai Hu), Angelicae radix (Dang Gui or Dong Quai), Paeoniae radix alba (Bai Shao), Atractylodis rhizome macrocephalae (Bai Zhu), Poria cocos (Fu Ling), Zingiberis siccatum rhizome (Sheng Jiang), Menthae haplocalycis (Bo He), and Glycyrrhizae radix (Gan Cao or Licorice). Xiao Yao San has a long history of use as a treatment for depression, anxiety and stress. Accumulating evidence also suggests its potential as a treatment for functional gastrointestinal disorders . A modified version known as Dan Zhi XYS or Jia Wei XYS was developed with two additional herbs with cooling properties: Cortex Moutan (Mu Dan Pi) and Fructus Gardeniae (Zhi Zi). This formulation is used both in China and Japan to manage symptoms such as mood, anxiety, fatigue, and insomnia associated with climacteric syndrome. Jia Wei XYS is also the most prescribed product for breast cancer patients according to the Taiwan health insurance research database . In addition, a large retrospective study found that Jia Wei XYS was frequently utilized (nearly a third of all herbal prescriptions) by breast cancer patients treated with tamoxifen. The authors reported notable reductions in the risk of endometrial cancer along with statistically non-significant improvements in tamoxifen-induced side effects . Another study of cervical cancer patients in Taiwan reported reduction in mortality rate and improvement in survival probability with adjunctive use of Jia Wei XYS . This formula has also been positively correlated with reduced risk of dementia . Below are the major symptoms for which XYS and Jia Wei XYS are prescribed along with current clinical evidence. Depression A systematic review of 26 RCTs involving 1,837 depressive patients found that XYS and its modified forms combined with antidepressants (selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs), tricyclics and tetracyclics) were superior to antidepressants alone. The formulae also improved HAMD scores without increasing the number of adverse events . Another review of 5 XYS studies with 1,260 participants concluded that despite some positive findings, the use of Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) for depression cannot be fully substantiated . But growing evidence since then suggests otherwise. A meta-analysis of 40 trials, which included 11 XYS studies, with 3,549 participants reported better clinical outcomes with CHM based on HAMD scores. Furthermore, adding CHM to conventional treatments reduced the adverse effects associated with their use; CHM alone also caused fewer adverse events compared with antidepressants . An additional review of 55 studies, which included 12 XYS trials, with 5,572 participants yielded similar findings: CHM with or without SSRIs (fluoxetine, paroxetine and sertraline) was associated with statistically significant improvements in HAMD scores causing fewer, less severe adverse effects . XYS may also be relevant in cancer settings. In a review of 18 trials, which included 4 XYS studies, and 1,441 gastric, lung, esophageal, breast and liver cancer patients, CHM users had fewer side effects compared to conventional antidepressants. Adverse events included functional gastrointestinal disorders, sleep disturbances, blurred vision, and fatigue. However, the authors did not perform subgroup analysis for the different cancer types or disease stage . Anxiety Both XYS and Jia Wei XYS have been studied for their potential anxiolytic effects. A systematic review and meta-analysis of 9 trials with 681 patients reported that XYS, alone or in combination with conventional medicine, helped improve sleep quality and relieve anxiety . In an 8-week, multi-center trial of 192 patients with mild to moderate depression and anxiety, Jia Wei XYS was comparable to sertraline in improving HAMD, HAMA, and Clinical Global Impression Scale scores with sustained benefits at the 12-week follow-up. Jia Wei XYS was also associated with lower adverse event rate . Insomnia Data show that 40-60% of patients with mood disorders develop insomnia before developing symptoms associated with mood disorders . In the trial described above , the authors reported that in addition to improving anxiety, Jia Wei XYS also affected reductions in symptoms of sleep disorder at the 12-week follow up. Additionally, in patients with psychological stress insomnia, Jia Wei XYS, used alone or in combination with the benzodiazepene estazolam, led to subjective improvements in sleep quality . Although current evidence suggests benefits of both XYS and Jia Wei XYS, majority of the above mentioned studies are limited by small sample size, risk of bias, variations in treatment duration and dosage, and medication compliance. Larger, methodologically-robust trials are needed to generate more definitive data.",,"The mechanisms underlying the biological effects of XYS have yet to be elucidated. Recent findings suggest that it exerts anti-depressant effects by regulating lactic acid, glycerol, glutamine, glutamic acid, hypoxanthine, myo-inositol and cholesterol levels, which are involved in D-glutamine and D-glutamate metabolism, arginine biosynthesis as well as alanine, aspartate and glutamate metabolism (11).",,Free and Easy Wanderer | Rambling Powder | Jia Wei Xiao Yao San | Dan Zhi Xiao Yao San | Augmented rambling powder | Kamishoyosan | TJ-24,,,Xiao Yao San,
DSI007873,Yunnan Baiyao,None,"Yunnan Baiyao (YNBY; “White medicine from the Province of Yunnan” in Mandarin), is among the well-known proprietary traditional Chinese medicine products. It was formulated a century ago and became a popular remedy for wound healing during the Vietnam War. In the last few decades, the trade name YNBY has been expanded into a product line that includes pills, tinctures, and toothpaste. The original formula is believed to contain multiple herbs with notoginseng as the main ingredient. It is also promoted as a dietary supplement that can be used both externally and internally to stop bleeding and to treat cancer in humans and in animals. Other claims include relief from minor aches and pains associated with backache, arthritis, strains, bruises, and sprains . In vitro and animal studies suggest YNBY and notoginseng have hemostatic , anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial effects. Notoginseng by itself demonstrated anticoagulant, antiplatelet , and fibrinolytic activities. Clinical studies suggest that YNBY may help treat uterine hemorrhage, ulcerative colitis and skin ulcers . Other preliminary data suggest topical application of a yunnan baiyao paste may reduce hospital-acquired pressure ulcers . It also reduced intraoperative blood loss during prostate and oral surgery . Case reports suggest that adjunctive topical YNBY may reduce bleeding in cancer patients , but it has not been studied as a cancer treatment. Ginsenosides derived from notoginseng may exert estrogenic effects and stimulate growth of hormone-sensitive breast cancer cells .",,"YNBY demonstrates hemostatic effects when applied topically on open wounds (2). Microscopic examination identified nanofiber components which may help activate blood clotting, act as scaffolding for tissue repair, and prevent infection by wound sealing (4). Preclinical studies suggest anti-inflammatory activity may occur through lymphocyte suppression and proinflammatory cytokine expression (11) and modulation of COX and LOX pathways (30). YNBY extract may also activate intracellular prostaglandin E(2) and thromboxane B(2) in osteoblasts (8).
Anticoagulant and antiplatelet effects by notoginseng may occur via fibrinogen reduction (6) (7). Notoginseng also protected endothelial function and vascular integrity by regulating focal adhesion kinase, integrin expression and NF-kappa B functions (19) (20), and inhibited vascular intimal hyperplasia by lowering expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen, cyclinE, cyclinD1, FN and MMP-9. (21). Antimicrobial activity has been suggested in a Pseudomonas aeruginosa model, wherein a water extract of YNBY reduced bacterial virulence by affecting quorum-sensing signaling and reducing biofilm formation (5).
In other studies, notoginsenoside Ft1, a saponin constituent, induced platelet aggregation by binding to platelet P2Y12 receptors (3). It demonstrated anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting neutrophil function and NO and PGE2 production through reduced iNOS and COX-2 expression (10). In peritoneal macrophages, notoginseng had a bidirectional regulatory effect, inhibiting COX-2 expression at an early stage and elevating it at a later stage (22). Data also suggest it can inhibit expression of NF-kappaB activity and TNF-alpha mRNA (12). Notoginseng may play a role in periodontal disease treatment by suppressing MMP-2 expression and by inhibiting breakdown of bone tissue (9). In another study, Ginsenoside-Rd isolated from notoginseng reduced atherosclerosis by inhibiting LDL uptake and cholesterol accumulation in macrophages (23).
Some studies report that notoginseng and constituent ginsenosides mimic estrogen (16) by binding and activating the estrogen receptor (18) and ER-alpha pathway (17). In an animal study, notoginseng selectively sensitized tumor cells to radiation (24). However, this effect has not been demonstrated in humans.",,Yun Nan Pai Yao,,,Yunnan Baiyao,

DSI007875,Zyflamend,C1956582,"Zyflamend is a formulation containing 10 different herbs. It is marketed as a dietary supplement for healthy inflammation response and normal cardiovascular and joint function . Laboratory studies suggest that the ingredients in Zyflamend have anti-inflammatory, antiangiogenic, and antiproliferative properties . In preclinical studies, Zyflamend inhibits proliferation of oral squamous carcinoma , pancreatic cancer , and melanoma , as well as cisplatin-resistant bladder cancer cells . In an animal model, it inhibited growth of both hormone-sensitive/insensitive prostate cancer, and reduced expression of prostate specific antigen (PSA) . It also suppressed elevated levels of proinflammatory mediators and aromatase in obese models and significantly reduced adipose tissue in mice . Studies in humans are quite limited. In a phase I trial in men with prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia, Zyflamend did not cause any serious adverse events, and significant reductions in serum C-reactive protein and nuclear factor-kappa B levels were observed . There have also been a few cases of clinical response to combination therapy that included a Zyflamend regimen in patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer . More studies are warranted to evaluate safety and effectiveness. Zyflamend may potentiate the cytotoxic effects of certain chemotherapeutic agents including gemcitabine , taxol , doxorubicin , and bicalutamide .",,"Ingredients in Zyflamend, including holy basil, turmeric, ginger, green tea, rosemary, hu zhang, Chinese gold thread, and Scutellaria, inhibit COX-2 activity and thereby reduce inflammation.
In vitro, Zyflamend inhibited inflammatory enzymes, decreased retinoblastoma protein phosphorylation (10), and induced apoptosis in human prostate cancer cells (2) (3) (4) (11). It also reduced androgen receptor signaling and enhanced bicalutamide-induced apoptosis (9). Other studies in prostate cancer cell lines suggest that Zyflamend inhibits class I and class II histone deacetylase expression, upregulates p21 expression (13), and regulates upstream kinases LKB1 and CaMKK2 via AMPK activation (14).
In melanoma cells, Zyflamend induced autophagy and apoptosis sequentially by activating the intrinsic caspase cascade. Cell migration and COX-2 expression were also suppressed (5). It also inhibited NF-kappa B activation in myeloid leukemia, lung adenocarcinoma (2), pancreatic (4), and cisplatin-resistant bladder cancer cells (15). In leukoplakia and skin cell lines, both Zyflamend and carnosol, an antioxidant phenolic constituent, inhibited mutagenesis via Hsp90 ATPase inhibition, which led to reduced aryl hydrocarbon receptor levels and CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 suppression (12).
Both a cellular model of obesity-related inflammation and an obese animal model indicate that Zyflamend blocks proinflammatory mediators and aromatase induction as well as Akt and NF-kB activation. Increased aromatase mRNA levels and mammary gland activity were also partially inhibited (7). Reduction of adiposity was attributed to AMPK activation (16).
In a murine xenograft model of prostate cancer, Zyflamend inhibited androgen-dependent tumor growth and histone deacetylase-5, biomarkers linked to prostate cancer progression (6). It also reduced the number of inflammatory cells, hyperplasia and dysplasia, and tumor incidence and number, and inhibited cell proliferation in an animal model of oral squamous cell carcinoma (3).",,Zyflamend,,,Zyflamend,
