nutrition,Healthy Protein Bar With High Protein?,"I've been looking for a better protein bar as my go-to, but pretty much every protein bar I look at has sketchy additives. I generally use Yuka to get an overview of the health stats and potential risky additives, and almost everything I check with it has low scores because of the additives. I currently eat RxBars because they have no additives, but I don't like how sugary they ar, and for not a whole lot of protein (12g). Would love any recs from folks out there that may have tried to similarly find a great healthy option for protein bars without any additives, high protein, and low sugar.",12,47,1767209784.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/nutrition/comments/1q0lhd5/healthy_protein_bar_with_high_protein/,1q0lhd5,2025-12-31 19:36:24
nutrition,Is Collagen protein viable for muscle building? What if I pair it with something high in Tryptophan?,"I understand that collagen alone likely will not aid in muscle growth, because it lacks tryptophan and is thus an incomplete protein. But like, if I consume 15 grams of collagen-sourced protein and also make sure to eat proteins high in tryptophan, like meat, can I count it towards my protein goal?

I feel like there isn’t a strong consensus on this. I love Built Puff bars so I’m hoping the answer is yes.

Is this possible? As far as I have been able to determine, none of the ingredients are nearly dense enough in fiber to produce a bar so packed with fiber. 

I'm not a nutrition researcher, so for all I know there are factors that go into this that I am not accounting for. The only possibility I can think of, assuming ingredients and nutrition are correct, is that they are marketing modified starch as fiber.

supplements,Ashwagandha made me put on weight!,"I have ADHD (I think may relate to dopamine issues) and was taking Ashwa once daily and sometimes doubling or tripling dosage depending on demands of the following day to keep the edge off and help sleep. I've also been sober and focusing really intensely on my career without a break so the edge was rather sharp so to speak. I know this dosage isn't recommended. And 6 months into this habit, I found myself unable to cry in acting class (I could cry on my own no problem) and compulsively eating but nothing ever felt like 'enough'. Feedback in my acting classes was 'where is your drive' and I found I couldn't muster it or even be bothered to. Peaceful apathy is what I'd call it. Not useful in these situations.  
  
I eat a fresh wholefoods diet minus protein bars (5 star health ratings only) and have a very very active lifestyle. I intermittently fast whenever my schedule is available for it- which means 2-3 times a week. But once I started eating, it was like I couldn't stop! It wasn't until I was 6kg over my optimal, feeling clogged and sluggish that I realised I just simply wasn't getting a kick or satisfaction out of food- like my reward system had completely been dampened. It was actually a scary feeling- the food compulsions, because it felt like I had no control, and I've always prided myself in discipline. I know 6kg doesn't sound like much but I essentially when from a size 6 to 10 ladies- I'll admit a lot of it is muscle but it's not lean and I hate how heavy my body feels when it has too much muscle on it- I'm a dancer so fluidity and lightness is important. 

I'm now over 2 weeks off ashwa and my tears in acting class are returning! But so is the blushing and anxiety... which I'm not so stoked about. But I'm finding that any overeating feels less compulsive and more habitual at this point which is super exciting. So keen to shed off these extra kilos and feel like myself again, I'm glad this all coincided with 'bulking season'. Definitely learnt my lesson on dosage!

This won't be an easy answer.

In my normal diet I try for high protein low-carb. More vegetables than starch. 

I just moved so kitchen really not set up. And then I got sick and it's just difficult to even stand. I've gotten carry out /delivery food three times in the last seven days. Not pleased with myself for that. And, because I don't want a huge plate of rice or noodles or a pizza, my DoorDash options get costly.

Later I went to a Target and saw a pack of clearance Bayer tablets that had also expired back in December. So that's nice.

We serve medsurg patients and also make food to serve in the cafe for staff and other patients. Most of the time we have a decent amount of food left, so after lunch, we put some in containers for people that need food when we are closed (like overnight staff) and then all of us kitchen staff get to take whatever is left for free. This includes random things on the salad bar. Additionally, any food that expires (pre portioned meals/sandwiches, baked goods, ingredients) we get to take home for free. Also, all staff get to eat 2 meals a day for free.

frugal,I tend to spend $4K over my budget on convenient and delicious food but it improves my quality of life by a lot. How can I make up for this cost or lower it by a bit?,"Quick summary: A big pillar for my mood is food and a big pillar for my self-esteem is my physique.

I found the cheat code to maintaining my physique without being miserable and while actually enjoying the process by quickly getting high protein lower calorie delicious foods quickly (picking them up from fast food spots).

But over the year, this costs me an extra 4K or so. For reference, I need like 160g a day. I know there's options like protein shakes which actually costs less even though it's expensive since it's like $5 for 120g of protein and even more for protein bars which is like $15 for 120g of protein.

The thing is, I can only do the shakes so often because all that liquid in my stomach triggers my acid reflux. I can do protein bars but eating 1200 cals worth of protein bars is just as expensive and also depressing. The max I can do is like 4 in a day and then I'm tapped.

Anyways, I have 4K overhead on food costs. How can I bring them down a bit while keep the convenience and deliciousness or cover it with something like churning bank accounts or something?

Looking for ideas on a side hustle in the meantime on weekends to supplement my life in the meantime. I am looking for a job I can pick up on Fri, sat, and sun, while I'm home. I travel out of town mon-thurs. I can't really do something via phone from home because I have a yapper of a dog, I've been serving in a restaurant for years but I'm rather burnt out on that, and they aren't likely to say yes unless I commit to an absurd schedule. Flexibility, then pay are my 2 priorities. I'm thinking about deliveries via Walmart, food, Uber, etc. I'm mostly leaning totowards Walmart currently based on something my brother said a while back with his time delivering. Might look into a café I've been to twice that's only open for select hours on the weekends since I know they have customers and can fill my mornings. I'm open to remote work as well and any other ideas.

The next little bit is to paint a picture of where I am at, not completely necessary to the job hunt question.

I am a couple of months into my travelling  insurance salesman position. I've seen vast improvement, but still have a ways to go before i reach the point of consistent sales ever week. Even my smallest product could pay $250. Thanks to my time riding with and making sales along with my managers I have a cushybuffer, but I'm still worried I will slip up later if I don't have some more income than I currently do, and I'llhave to quit this job before i can take off with it fully. I just recently got my second ever solo sale on my own (could be 3rd but another gal ran into some trouble as we were finishing the application and we werent ablr to go through), I work on 100% commissions and between the hotel and gas, my operating expenses are $400 a week on top of my monthly $380 car payment and monthly $700 for rent. I live with family so some of that 700 goes towards other bills, groceries, etc. I also factor in another 150 as necessities come up. I also have some personal subscriptions that amount to 100 a month. The only hard keeps I have are my PF gym membership and xbox live monthlies. I'm planning to look those all over and make some cuts as well for the time being. I avoid eating out, buying new games, going to bars, things that would cost me overtime. My most extravagant optional purchases are my workout supplements for protein powder, pre workout, and creatine. I am also college educated with a degree in marketing and general business.

I've also been getting fruit cups and protein shakes/ bars from ALDI for extra nutrients and vitamins. can't wait to get into a house and cook some steak tho omfg",4909,447,1716577119.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Frugal/comments/1czsdmy/ive_been_eating_2_per_meal_for_a_few_weeks_now/,1czsdmy,2024-05-24 18:58:39
frugal,Healthier Recipes for Chocolate Bars,"I bought 12 fair trade dark choc bars (expiration date 12/23    - 50 cents each. I need healthier recipes to use them in before they bloom. I am trying to eat healthier so recipes for s'mores, cakes and brownies aren't helping.

The first idea I am going to try is snicker dates. Put all natural peanut butter in a cut date and cover in melted choc. Okay, your turn.

Update: the ""snicker Dates"" are delish. Super easy . I'll take a few for work everyday for a little sweet break in the afternoon.

Also dipped bananas.

I am currently making chocolate dipped cherry greek yogurt cluster (tic toc recipe) I make my own yogurt in the instapot and I love it. 1 gallon of nonfat milk makes about 2 quarts of yummy greek yogurt. that is about 128 grams of protein for 2.75. It is so simple with my 1 gallon yogurt strainer tupperware thing-y. I just pour it in and leave it in there until I have only 4 T left and that is the next batch starter.",3,10,1709399236.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Frugal/comments/1b4t3by/healthier_recipes_for_chocolate_bars/,1b4t3by,2024-03-02 17:07:16
